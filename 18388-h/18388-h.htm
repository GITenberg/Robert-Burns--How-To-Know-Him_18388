<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have not the most distant pretence to what the pye-coated
guardians of Escutcheons call a Gentleman. When at Edinburgh last
winter, I got acquainted at the Herald's office; and looking thro'
the granary of honors, I there found almost every name in the
kingdom; but for me,</p>

<p class="center">
My ancient but ignoble blood<br />
Has crept thro' scoundrels since the flood.
</p>

<p>Gules, purpure, argent, etc., quite disowned me. My forefathers
rented land of the famous, noble Keiths of Marshal, and had the
honor to share their fate. I do not use the word &lsquo;honor&rsquo; with any
reference to political principles: <i>loyal</i> and <i>disloyal</i> I take
to be merely relative terms in that ancient and formidable court
known in this country by the name of &lsquo;club-law.&rsquo; Those who dare
welcome Ruin and shake hands with Infamy, for <a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>what they believe
sincerely to be the cause of their God or their King, are&mdash;as Mark
Antony in <i>Shakspear</i> says of Brutus and Cassius&mdash;&lsquo;honorable men.&rsquo;
I mention this circumstance because it threw my Father on the
world at large; where, after many years' wanderings and
sojournings, he picked up a pretty large quantity of observation
and experience, to which I am indebted for most of my pretensions
to Wisdom. I have met with few who understood Men, their manners
and their ways, equal to him; but stubborn, ungainly Integrity,
and headlong, ungovernable Irascibility, are disqualifying
circumstances; consequently, I was born, a very poor man's son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can now, Sir, form a pretty near guess of what sort of Wight
he is, whom for some time you have honored with your
correspondence. That Whim and Fancy, keen sensibility and riotous
passions, may still make him zig-zag in his future path of life is
very probable; but, come what will, I shall answer for him&mdash;the
most determinate integrity and honor [shall ever characterise
him]; and though his evil star should again blaze in his meridian
with tenfold more direful influence, he may reluctantly tax
friendship with pity, but no more.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>These two paragraphs form respectively the beginning and the end of a
long autobiographical letter written by Robert Burns to Doctor John
Moore, physician and novelist. At the time they were composed, the
poet had just returned to his native county after the triumphant
season in Edinburgh that formed the climax of his career. But no
detailed knowledge of circumstances is necessary to rouse interest in
a man who wrote like that. You may be offended by the
self-consciousness and the swagger, or you may be charmed by the
frankness and dash, but you can not remain indifferent. Burns had many
moods besides those reflected in these sentences, but here we can see
as vividly as in any of his poetry the fundamental characteristics of
the man&mdash;sensitive, passionate, independent, and as proud as
Lucifer&mdash;whose life and work are the subject of this volume.</p>


<h3><a name="SECTION1" id="SECTION1"></a>1. Alloway, Mount Oliphant, and Lochlea</h3>

<p>William Burnes, the father of the poet, came of a family of farmers
and gardeners in the county of Kincardine, on the east coast of
Scotland. At the age of twenty-seven, he left his native district for
the south; and when Robert,<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a> his eldest child, was born on January 25,
1759, William was employed as gardener to the provost of Ayr. He had
besides leased some seven acres of land, of which he planned to make a
nursery and market-garden, in the neighboring parish of Alloway; and
there near the Brig o' Doon built with his own hands the clay cottage
now known to literary pilgrims as the birthplace of Burns. His wife,
Agnes Brown, the daughter of an Ayrshire farmer, bore him, besides
Robert, three sons and three daughters. In order to keep his sons at
home instead of sending them out as farm-laborers, the elder Burnes
rented in 1766 the farm of Mount Oliphant, and stocked it on borrowed
money. The venture did not prosper, and on a change of landlords the
family fell into the hands of a merciless agent, whose bullying the
poet later avenged by the portrait of the factor in <i><a href="#THE_TWA_DOGS">The Twa Dogs</a></i>.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I've noticed, on our Laird's court-day,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">And mony a time my heart's been wae,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">Poor tenant bodies, scant o' cash,</div>
<div class="i0">How they maun thole a factor's snash;</div>
<div class="i0">He'll stamp and threaten, curse and swear,</div>
<div class="i0">He'll apprehend them, poind their gear;</div>
<div class="i0">While they maun stan', wi' aspect humble,</div>
<div class="i0">And hear it a', and fear and tremble!</div>
</div></div>
<p><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>In 1777 Mount Oliphant was exchanged for the farm of Lochlea, about
ten miles away, and here William Burnes labored for the rest of his
life. The farm was poor, and with all he could do it was hard to keep
his head above water. His health was failing, he was harassed with
debts, and in 1784 in the midst of a lawsuit about his lease, he died.</p>

<p>In spite of his struggle for a bare subsistence, the elder Burnes had
not neglected the education of his children. Before he was six, Robert
was sent to a small school at Alloway Mill, and soon after his father
joined with a few neighbors to engage a young man named John Murdoch
to teach their children in a room in the village. This arrangement
continued for two years and a half, when, Murdoch having been called
elsewhere, the father undertook the task of education himself. The
regular instruction was confined chiefly to the long winter evenings,
but quite as important as this was the intercourse between father and
sons as they went about their work.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; says the poet's brother Gilbert, &ldquo;was for some time
almost the only companion we had. He conversed familiarly on all
subjects<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a> with us, as if we had been men; and was at great pains,
as we accompanied him in the labours of the farm, to lead the
conversation to such subjects as might tend to increase our
knowledge, or confirm our virtuous habits. He borrowed Salmon's
<i>Geographical Grammar</i> for us, and endeavoured to make us
acquainted with the situation and history of the different
countries in the world; while, from a book-society in Ayr, he
procured for us Derham's <i>Physics and Astro-Theology</i>, and Ray's
<i>Wisdom of God in the Creation</i>, to give us some idea of astronomy
and natural history. Robert read all these books with an avidity
and industry scarcely to be equalled. My father had been a
subscriber to Stackhouse's <i>History of the Bible</i> ...; from this
Robert collected a competent knowledge of ancient history; for no
book was so voluminous as to slacken his industry, or so
antiquated as to dampen his researches. A brother of my mother,
who had lived with us some time, and had learned some arithmetic
by our winter evening's candle, went into a book-seller's shop in
Ayr to purchase the <i>Ready Reckoner, or Tradesman's Sure Guide</i>,
and a book to teach him to write letters. Luckily, in place of the
<i>Complete Letter-Writer</i>, he got by mistake a<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a> small collection of
letters by the most eminent writers, with a few sensible
directions for attaining an easy epistolary style. This book was
to Robert of the greatest consequence. It inspired him with a
strong desire to excel in letter-writing, while it furnished him
with models by some of the first writers in our language.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Interesting as are the details as to the antiquated manuals from which
Burns gathered his general information, it is more important to note
the more personal implications in this account. Respect for learning
has long been wide-spread among the peasantry of Scotland, but it is
evident that William Burnes was intellectually far above the average
of his class. The schoolmaster Murdoch has left a portrait of him in
which he not only extols his virtues as a man but emphasizes his zest
for things of the mind, and states that &ldquo;he spoke the English language
with more propriety&mdash;both with respect to diction and
pronunciation&mdash;than any man I ever knew, with no greater advantages.&rdquo;
Though tender and affectionate, he seems to have inspired both wife
and children with a reverence amounting to awe, and he struck
strangers as reserved and austere. He recog<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>nized in Robert traces of
extraordinary gifts, but he did not hide from him the fact that his
son's temperament gave him anxiety for his future. Mrs. Burnes was a
devoted wife and mother, by no means her husband's intellectual equal,
but vivacious and quick-tempered, with a memory stored with the song
and legend of the country-side. Other details can be filled in from
the poet's own picture of his father's household as given with little
or no idealization in <i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">The Cotter's Saturday Night</a></i>.</p>

<p>No less impressive than that of his father is the intellectual hunger
of the future poet himself. We have had Gilbert's testimony to the
eagerness with which he devoured such books as came within his reach,
and the use he made of his later fragments of schooling points the
same way. He had a quarter at the parish school of Dalrymple when he
was thirteen; and in the following summer he attended the school at
Ayr under his former Alloway instructor. Murdoch's own account of
these three weeks gives an idea of Burns's quickness of apprehension;
and the style of it is worth noting with reference to the
characteristics of the poet's own prose.</p>

<blockquote><p><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>&ldquo;In 1773,&rdquo; says Murdoch, &ldquo;Robert Burns came to board and lodge
with me, for the purpose of revising English grammar, etc., that
he might be better qualified to instruct his brothers and sisters
at home. He was now with me day and night, in school, at all
meals, and in all my walks. At the end of one week, I told him as
he was now pretty much master of the parts of speech, etc., I
should like to teach him something of French pronunciation, that
when he should meet with the name of a French town, ship, officer,
or the like, in the newspapers, he might be able to pronounce it
something like a French word. Robert was glad to hear this
proposal, and immediately we attacked the French with great
courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there was little else to be heard but the declension of
nouns, the conjugation of verbs, etc. When walking together, and
even at meals, I was constantly telling him the names of different
objects, as they presented themselves, in French; so that he was
hourly laying in a stock of words, and sometimes little phrases.
In short, he took such pleasure in learning, and I in teaching,
that it was difficult to say which of the two was most zealous in
the business; and about the end of the second week of our study of
the<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a> French, we began to read a little of the <i>Adventures of
Telemachus</i> in F&eacute;nelon's own words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now the plains of Mount Oliphant began to whiten, and Robert
was summoned to relinquish the pleasing scenes that surrounded the
grotto of Calypso, and armed with a sickle, to seek glory by
signalising himself in the fields of Ceres; and so he did, for
although but about fifteen, I was told that he performed the work
of a man.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>The record of Burns's school-days is completed by the mention of a
sojourn, probably in the summer of 1775, in his mother's parish of
Kirkoswald. Hither he went to study mathematics and surveying under a
teacher of local note, and, in spite of the convivial attractions of a
smuggling village, seems to have made progress in his geometry till
his head was turned by a girl who lived next door to the school.</p>

<p>So far the education gained by Burns from his schoolmasters and his
father had been almost exclusively moral and intellectual. It was in
less formal ways that his imagination was fed. From his mother he had
heard from infancy the ballads, legends, and songs that were
traditionary among<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a> the peasantry; and the influence of these was
re-enforced by a certain Betty Davidson, an unfortunate relative of
his mother's to whom the family gave shelter for a time.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In my infant and boyish days, too,&rdquo; he writes in the letter to
Doctor Moore already quoted, &ldquo;I owed much to an old maid of my
mother's, remarkable for her ignorance, credulity, and
superstition. She had, I suppose, the largest collection in the
country, of tales and songs concerning devils, ghosts, fairies,
brownies, witches, warlocks, spunkies, kelpies, elf-candles,
dead-lights, wraiths, apparitions, cantraips, enchanted towers,
giants, dragons, and other trumpery. This cultivated the latent
seeds of Poesy; but had so strong an effect on my imagination,
that to this hour, in my nocturnal rambles, I sometimes keep a
sharp look-out in suspicious places; and though nobody can be more
sceptical in these matters than I, yet it often takes an effort of
philosophy to shake off these idle terrors.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>His private reading also contained much that must have stimulated his
imagination and broadened his interests. It began with a <i>Life of
Han<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>nibal</i>, and Hamilton's modernized version of the <i>History of Sir
William Wallace</i>, which last, he says, with the touch of flamboyancy
that often recurs in his style, &ldquo;poured a Scottish prejudice in my
veins, which will boil along there till the flood-gates of life shut
in eternal rest.&rdquo; By the time he was eighteen he had, in addition to
books already mentioned, become acquainted with Shakespeare, Pope
(including the translation of Homer), Thomson, Shenstone, Allan
Ramsay, and a <i>Select Collection of Songs, Scotch and English</i>; with
the <i>Spectator</i>, the <i>Pantheon</i>, Locke's <i>Essay on the Human
Understanding</i>, Sterne, and Henry Mackenzie. To these must be added
some books on farming and gardening, a good deal of theology, and, of
course, the Bible.</p>

<p>The pursuing of intellectual interests such as are implied in this
list is the more significant when we remember that it was carried on
in the scanty leisure of a life of labor so severe that it all but
broke the poet's health, and probably left permanent marks on his
physique. Yet he had energy left for still other avocations. It was
when he was no more than fifteen that he first experienced the twin
passions that came to dominate his life, love and song. The girl who
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: This sentence was split across a pagebreak and may have a word or words missing">was<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a> the</ins> occasion was his partner in the harvest field, Nelly
Kilpatrick; the song he addressed to her is the following:</p>

<p>Since there may still be readers who suppose that Burns was a mere
unsophisticated singer, without power of self-criticism, it may be as
well to insert here a passage from a Commonplace Book written in 1783,
ten years after the composition of the song.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center"><i>Criticism on the Foregoing Song</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lest my works should be thought below Criticism; or meet with a
Critic who, perhaps, will not look on them with so candid and
favorable an eye; I am determined to criticise them myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first distich of the first stanza is quite too much in the
flimsy strain of our ordinary street ballads; and on the other
hand, the second distich is too much in the other extreme. The
expression is a little awkward, and the sentiment too serious.
Stanza the second I am well pleased with; and I think it conveys a
fine idea of that amiable part of the Sex&mdash;the agreeables, or what
in our Scotch dialect we call a sweet sonsy Lass. The third Stanza
has a little of the flimsy turn in it; and the<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a> third line has
rather too serious a cast. The fourth Stanza is a very indifferent
one; the first line is, indeed, all in the strain of the second
Stanza, but the rest is mostly an expletive. The thoughts in the
fifth Stanza come fairly up to my favorite idea [of] a sweet sonsy
Lass. The last line, however, halts a little. The same sentiments
are kept up with equal spirit and tenderness in the sixth Stanza,
but the second and fourth lines ending with short syllables hurts
the whole. The seventh Stanza has several minute faults; but I
remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion, and to
this hour I never recollect it but my heart melts, and my blood
sallies at the remembrance.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>In spite of the early start in poetry given him by Nelly Kilpatrick,
he did not produce more than a few pieces of permanent value during
the next ten years. He did, however, go on developing and branching
out in his social activities, in spite of the depressing grind of the
farm. He attended a dancing school (much against his father's will),
helped to establish a &ldquo;Bachelors' Club&rdquo; for debating, and found time
for further love-affairs. That with Ellison Begbie, celebrated by him
in<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a> <i>The Lass of Cessnock Banks</i>, he took very seriously, and he
proposed marriage to the girl in some portentously solemn epistles
which remain to us as the earliest examples of his prose. In order to
put himself in a position to marry, he determined to learn the trade
of flax-dressing; and though Ellison refused him, he went to the
neighboring seaport of Irvine to carry out his purpose in the summer
of 1781. The flax-dressing experiment ended disastrously with a fire
which burned the workshop, and Burns returned penniless to the farm.
The poems written about this time express profound melancholy, a mood
natural enough in the circumstances, and aggravated by his poor
nervous and physical condition.</p>

<p>But his spirit could not remain permanently depressed, and shortly
after his return to Lochlea, a trifling accident to a ewe he had
bought prompted him to the following delightful and characteristic
production.</p>

<p>How long he continued to mourn for Ellison Begbie, it is hard to say;
but the three following songs, inspired, it would seem, by three
different girls, testify at once to his power of recuperation<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a> and the
rapid maturing of his talent. All seem to have been written between
the date of his return from Irvine and the death of his father.</p>

<h3><a name="SECTION2" id="SECTION2"></a>2. Mossgiel</h3>

<p>On the death of their father, Robert and Gilbert Burns moved with the
family to the farm of Mossgiel in the next parish of Mauchline. By
putting in a claim for arrears of wages, they succeeded in drawing
enough from the wreck of<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a> their father's estate to supply a scanty
stock for the new venture. The records of the first summer show the
poet in anything but a happy frame of mind. His health was miserable;
and the loosening of his moral principles, which he ascribes to the
influence of a young sailor he had met at Irvine, bore fruit in the
birth to him of an illegitimate daughter by a servant girl, Elizabeth
Paton. The verses which carry allusion to this affair are illuminating
for his character. One group is devout and repentant; the other marked
sometimes by cynical bravado, sometimes by a note of exultation. Both
may be regarded as genuine enough expressions of moods which
alternated throughout his life, and which corresponded to conflicting
sides of his nature. Here is a typical example of the former:</p>

it with a tender pride, as sincere as his remorse:</p>

<p>At Mossgiel the Burns family was no more successful than in either of
its previous farms. Bad seed and bad weather gave two poor harvests,
and by the summer of 1786 the poet's financial condition was again
approaching desperation. His situation was made still more
embarrassing by the consequences of another of his amours. Shortly
after moving to the parish of Mauchline he had fallen in love with
Jean Armour, the daughter of a mason in the village. What was for
Burns a prolonged courtship ensued, and in the spring of 1786 he
learned that Jean's condition was such that he gave her a paper
acknowledging her as his wife. To his surprise and mortification the
girl's father, who is<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a> said to have had a personal dislike to him and
who well may have thought a man with his reputation and prospects was
no promising son-in-law, opposed the marriage, forced Jean to give up
the paper, and sent her off to another town. Burns chose to regard
Jean's submission to her father as inexcusable faithlessness, and
proceeded to indulge in the ecstatic misery of the lover betrayed.
There is no doubt that he suffered keenly from the affair: he writes
to his friends that he could &ldquo;have no nearer idea of the place of
eternal punishment&rdquo; than what he had felt in his &ldquo;own breast on her
account. I have tried often to forget her: I have run into all kinds
of dissipation and riot ... to drive her out of my head, but all in
vain.&rdquo; This is in a later letter than that in which he has &ldquo;sunk into
a lurid calm,&rdquo; and &ldquo;subsided into the time-settled sorrow of the sable
widower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet other evidence shows that at this crisis also Burns's emotional
experience was far from simple. It was probably during the summer of
the same year that there occurred the passages with the mysterious
Highland Mary, a girl whose identity, after voluminous controversy,
remains vague, but who inspired some of his loftiest love<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a> poetry.
Though Burns's feeling for her seems to have been a kind of interlude
in reaction from the &ldquo;cruelty&rdquo; of Jean, he idealized it beyond his
wont, and the subject of it has been exalted to the place among his
heroines which is surely due to the long-suffering woman who became
his wife.</p>

<p>In this same summer Burns formed the project of emigrating. He
proposed to go to the West Indies, and return for Jean when he had
made provision to support her. This offer was refused by James Armour,
but Burns persevered with the plan, obtained a position in Jamaica,
and in the autumn engaged passage in a ship sailing from Greenock. The
song, <i><a href="#WILL_YE_GO_TO_THE_INDIES_MY_MARY">Will Ye Go to the Indies; My Mary</a></i>, seems to imply that
Highland Mary was invited to accompany him, but substantial evidence
of this, as of most things concerning his relations with Mary
Campbell, is lacking. <i>From Thee, Eliza, I Must Go</i>, supposed to be
addressed to Elizabeth Miller, also belongs to this summer, and is
taken to refer to another of the &ldquo;under-plots in his drama of love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meantime, at the suggestion of his friend and patron, Gavin Hamilton,
Burns had begun to arrange for a subscription edition of his poems. It
seems to have been only after he went to Mossgiel<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a> that he had
seriously conceived the idea of writing for publication, and the
decision was followed by a year of the most extraordinary fertility in
composition. To 1785-1786 are assigned such satires as <i><a href="#HOLY_WILLIES_PRAYER">Holy Willie</a></i>
and the <i><a href="#ADDRESS_TO_THE_UNCO_GUID_OR_THE_RIGIDLY_RIGHTEOUS">Address to the Unco Guid</a></i>; a group of the longer poems
including <i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">The Cotter's Saturday Night</a></i>, <i><a href="#THE_JOLLY_BEGGARS">The Jolly Beggars</a></i>,
<i><a href="#HALLOWEEN">Halloween</a></i>, <i><a href="#THE_HOLY_FAIR">The Holy Fair</a></i>, <i><a href="#THE_TWA_DOGS">The Twa Dogs</a></i> and <i>The Vision</i>; some
shorter but no less famous pieces, such as the poems <i><a href="#TO_A_LOUSE">To a Louse</a></i>, <i><a href="#TO_A_MOUSE">To
a Mouse</a></i>, <i><a href="#ADDRESS_TO_THE_DEIL">To the Deil</a></i>, <i><a href="#TO_A_MOUNTAIN_DAISY">To a Mountain Daisy</a></i> and <i><a href="#SCOTCH_DRINK">Scotch Drink</a></i>; and
a number of the best of his <i>Epistles</i>. Many of these, especially the
church satires, had obtained a considerable local fame through
circulation in manuscript, so that, proposals having been issued for
an edition to be printed by Wilson of Kilmarnock, it was not found
difficult to obtain subscriptions for more than half the edition of
six hundred and twelve copies. The prospect of some return from this
enterprise induced James Armour to take legal measures to obtain
support for Jean's expected child, and Burns, fearing imprisonment,
was forced to go into hiding while his book was passing the press. The
church, too, had taken cognizance of his offense, and both Jean and he
had<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a> to stand up before the congregation on three occasions to receive
rebuke and make profession of repentance. He was at the same time
completing the preparations for his voyage. In such extraordinary
circumstances appeared the famous Kilmarnock edition, the immediate
success of which soon produced a complete alteration in the whole
outlook of the poet.</p>

<p>In the first place, the consideration Burns gained from his volume
induced Armour to relax his pursuit, and in September, when Jean
became the mother of twins, the poet was in such a mood that the
sentiment of paternity began to weigh against the proposed emigration.
Some weeks later he learned through a friend that Doctor Blacklock, a
poet and scholar of standing in literary circles in Edinburgh, had
praised his volume highly, and urged a second and larger edition. The
upshot was that he gave up his passage (his trunk had been packed and
was part way to Greenock), and determined instead on a visit to
Edinburgh. The only permanent result of the whole West Indian scheme
was thus a sheaf of amorous and patriotic farewells, of which the
following may be taken as examples:</p>

<h3><a name="SECTION3" id="SECTION3"></a>3. Edinburgh</h3>

<p>On the twenty-seventh of November, 1786, mounted on a borrowed pony,
Burns set out for Edinburgh. He seems to have arrived there without
definite plans, for, after having found lodging with his old friend
Richmond, he spent the first few days strolling about the city. At
home Burns had been an enthusiastic freemason, and it was through a
masonic friend, Mr. James Dalrymple of Orangefield, near Ayr, that he
was introduced to Edinburgh society. A decade or two earlier, that
society, under the leadership of men like Adam Smith and David Hume
had reached a high degree of intellectual distinction. A decade or two
later, under Sir Walter Scott and the Reviewers it was again to be in
some measure, if for the last time, a rival to London as a literary
center. But when Burns visited it there was a kind of interregnum,
and, little though he or they guessed it, none of the celebri<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>ties he
met possessed genius comparable to his own. In a very few weeks it was
evident that he was to be the lion of the season. By December
thirteenth he is writing to a friend at Ayr:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have found a worthy warm friend in Mr. Dalrymple, of
Orangefield, who introduced me to Lord Glencairn, a man whose
worth and brotherly kindness to me I shall remember when time
shall be no more. By his interest it is passed in the Caledonian
Hunt, and entered in their books, that they are to take each a
copy of the second edition [of the poems], for which they are to
pay one guinea. I have been introduced to a good many of the
Noblesse, but my avowed patrons and patronesses are the Duchess of
Gordon, the Countess of Glencairn, with my Lord and Lady
Betty&mdash;the Dean of Faculty [Honorable Henry Erskine]&mdash;Sir John
Whitefoord. I have likewise warm friends among the literati;
Professors [Dugald] Stewart, Blair, and Mr. Mackenzie&mdash;the Man of
Feeling.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Through Glencairn he met Creech the book-seller, with whom he
arranged for his second edition, and through the patrons he mentions
and the<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a> Edinburgh freemasons, among whom he was soon at home, a large
subscription list was soon made up. In the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> for
October, November, and December, James Sibbald had published favorable
notices of the Kilmarnock edition, with numerous extracts, and when
Henry Mackenzie gave it high praise in his <i>Lounger</i> for December
ninth, and the <i>London Monthly Review</i> followed suit in the same
month, it was felt that the poet's reputation was established.</p>

<p>Of Burns's bearing in the fashionable and cultivated society into
which he so suddenly found himself plunged we have many contemporary
accounts. They are practically unanimous in praise of the taste and
tact with which he acquitted himself. While neither shy nor
aggressive, he impressed every one with his brilliance in
conversation, his shrewdness in observation, and criticism, and his
poise and common sense in his personal relations. One of the best
descriptions of him was given by Sir Walter Scott to Lockhart. Scott
as a boy of sixteen met Burns at the house of Doctor Adam Ferguson,
and thus reports:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His person was strong and robust; his manners rustic, not
clownish; a sort of dignified plainness<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a> and simplicity, which
received part of its effect perhaps from one's knowledge of his
extraordinary talents.... I would have taken the poet, had I not
known what he was, for a very sagacious country farmer of the old
Scotch school; that is, none of your modern agriculturists who
keep labourers for their drudgery, but the <i>douce guidman</i> who
held his own plough. There was a strong expression of sense and
shrewdness in all his lineaments: the eye alone, I think,
indicated the poetical character and temperament. It was large,
and of a cast which glowed (I say literally glowed) when he spoke
with feeling or interest. I never saw such another eye in a human
head, though I have seen the most distinguished men of my time.
His conversation expressed perfect self-confidence, without the
slightest presumption. Among the men who were the most learned of
their time and country, he expressed himself with perfect
firmness, but without the least intrusive forwardness; and when he
differed an opinion, he did not hesitate to express it firmly, yet
at the same time with modesty.... I have only to add, that his
dress corresponded with his manner. He was like a farmer dressed
in his best to dine with the laird.<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a> I do not speak <i>in malam
partem</i>, when I say I never saw a man in company with his
superiors in station and information, more perfectly free from
either the reality or the affectation of embarrassment. I was
told, but did not observe it, that his address to females was
extremely deferential, and always with a turn either to the
pathetic or humorous, which engaged their attention particularly.
I have heard the Duchess of Gordon remark this.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Burns's letters written at this time show an amused consciousness of
his social prominence, but never for a moment did he lose sight of the
fact that it was only the affair of a season, and that in a few months
he would have to resume his humble station. Yet this intellectual
detachment did not prevent his enjoying opportunities for social and
intellectual intercourse such as he had never known and was never
again to know. Careful as he was to avoid presuming on his new
privileges, he clearly threw himself into the discussions in which he
took part with all the zest of his temperament; and in the less formal
convivial clubs to which he was welcomed he became at once the king of
good fellows. To the noble<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>men and others who befriended him he
expressed himself in language which may seem exaggerated; but the
warmth of his disposition, and the letter writers of the eighteenth
century on whom he had formed his style, sufficiently account for it
without the suspicion of affectation or flattery. Whatever his vices,
ingratitude to those who showed him kindness was not among them; and
the sympathetic reader is more apt to feel pathos than to take offense
in his tributes to his patrons. The real though not extraordinary
kindness of the Earl of Glencairn, for example, was acknowledged again
and again in prose and verse; and the <i>Lament</i> Burns wrote upon his
death closes with these lines which rewarded the noble lord with an
immortality he might otherwise have missed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The bridegroom may forget the bride</div>
<div class="i2">Was made his wedded wife yestreen;</div>
<div class="i0">The monarch may forget the crown</div>
<div class="i2">That on his head an hour has been;</div>
<div class="i0">The mother may forget the child</div>
<div class="i2">That smiles sae sweetly on her knee;</div>
<div class="i0">But I'll remember thee, Glencairn,</div>
<div class="i2">And a' that thou hast done for me!</div>
</div></div>

<p>After a sojourn of a little more than five months, Burns left
Edinburgh early in May for a<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a> tour in the south of Scotland. The poet
was mounted on an old mare, Jenny Geddes, which he had bought in
Edinburgh, and which he still owned when he settled at Ellisland. He
was accompanied by his bosom friend, Robert Ainslie. The letters and
journals written during the four weeks of this tour give evidence of
his appreciation of scenery and his shrewd judgment of character. He
was received with much consideration in the houses he visited, and was
given the freedom of the burgh of Dumfries. On the ninth of June,
1787, he was back at Mauchline; and, calling at Armour's house to see
his child, he was revolted by the &ldquo;mean, servile complaisance&rdquo; he met
with&mdash;the result of his Edinburgh triumphs. His disgust at the family,
however, did not prevent a renewal of his intimacy with Jean. After a
few days at home, he seems to have made a short tour in the West
Highlands. July was spent at Mossgiel, and early in August he returned
to Edinburgh in order to settle his accounts with Creech, his
publisher. On the twenty-fifth he set out for a longer tour in the
North accompanied by his friend Nicol, an Edinburgh schoolmaster, the
Willie who &ldquo;brewed a peck o' maut.&rdquo; They proceeded by Linlithgow,
Falkirk, Stirling, Crieff,<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a> Dunkeld, Aberfeldie, Blair Athole,
Strathspey, to Inverness. The most notable episode of the journey
northwards was a visit at the castle of the Duke of Athole, which
passed with great satisfaction to both Burns and his hosts, and of
which his <i>Humble Petition of Bruar Water</i> is a poetical memorial. At
Stonehaven and Montrose he extended his acquaintance among his
father's relatives. He reached Edinburgh again on September sixteenth,
having traveled nearly six hundred miles. In October he made still
another excursion, through Clackmannanshire and into the south of
Perthshire, visiting Ramsay of Ochtertyre, near Stirling, and Sir
William Murray of Ochtertyre in Strathearn. In all these visits made
by Burns to the houses of the aristocracy, it is interesting to note
his capacity for pleasing and profitable intercourse with people of a
class and tradition far removed from his own. Sensitive to an extreme
and quick to resent a slight, he was at the same time finely
responsive to kindness, and his conduct was governed by a tact and
frank naturalness that are among the not least surprising of his
powers. In spite of the fervor and floridness of some of his
expressions of gratitude for favors from his noble friends, Burns was
no<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a> snob; and it was characteristic of him to give up a visit to the
Duchess of Gordon rather than separate from his companion Nicol, who,
in a fit of jealous sulks, refused to accompany him to Castle Gordon.</p>

<p>The settlement with Creech proved to be a very tedious affair, and in
the beginning of December the poet was about to leave the city in
disgust when an accident occurred which gave opportunity for one of
the most extraordinary episodes in the history of his relations with
women. Just before, he had met a Mrs. McLehose who lived in Edinburgh
with her three children, while her husband, from whom she had
separated on account of ill-treatment, had emigrated to Jamaica. A
correspondence began immediately after the first meeting, with the
following letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Madam</i>:</p>

<p style="text-indent:1.5em; margin-top:0;">&ldquo;I had set no small store by my tea-drinking tonight, and have not
often been so disappointed. Saturday evening I shall embrace the
opportunity with the greatest pleasure. I leave this town this day
se'ennight, and probably I shall not return for a couple of
twelvemonths; but I must ever regret that I so lately got an
acquaintance I shall<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a> ever highly esteem, and in whose welfare I
shall ever be warmly interested. Our worthy common friend, Miss
Nimmo, in her usual pleasant way, rallied me a good deal on my new
acquaintance, and, in the humour of her ideas, I wrote some lines,
which I enclose to you, as I think they have a good deal of poetic
merit; and Miss Nimmo tells me that you are not only a critic but
a poetess. Fiction, you know, is the native region of poetry; and
I hope you will pardon my vanity in sending you the bagatelle as a
tolerable offhand <i>jeu d'esprit</i>. I have several poetic trifles,
which I shall gladly leave with Miss Nimmo or you, if they were
worth house-room; as there are scarcely two people on earth by
whom it would mortify me more to be forgotten, though at the
distance of nine score miles. I am, Madam, With the highest
respect,</p>

<p class="quotsig">&ldquo;Your very humble servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robert Burns</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>[December 6, 1787.]</p></blockquote>

<p>The night before Burns was to take tea with his new acquaintance, he
was overturned by a drunken coachman, and received an injury to his
knee which confined him to his rooms for several<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a> weeks. Meantime the
correspondence went on with ever-increasing warmth, from &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;
through &ldquo;My dearest Madam,&rdquo; &ldquo;my dear kind friend,&rdquo; &ldquo;my lovely friend,&rdquo;
to &ldquo;my dearest angel.&rdquo; They early agreed to call each other Clarinda
and Sylvander, and the Arcadian names are significant of the
sentimental nature of the relation. By the time of their second
meeting&mdash;about a month after the first,&mdash;they had exchanged intimate
confidences, had discovered endless affinities, and had argued by the
page on religion, Clarinda striving to win Sylvander over to her
orthodox Calvinism. When he was again able to go out, his visits
became for both of them &ldquo;exquisite&rdquo; and &ldquo;rapturous&rdquo; experiences,
Clarinda struggling to keep on the safe side of discretion by means of
&ldquo;Reason&rdquo; and &ldquo;Religion,&rdquo; Sylvander protesting his complete submission
to her will. The appearance of passion in their letters goes on
increasing, and Clarinda's fits of perturbation in the next morning's
reflections grow more acute. She does not seem to have become the
poet's mistress, and it is impossible to gather what either of them
expected the outcome of their intercourse to be. With a few notable
exceptions, the verses which were occasioned rather than in<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>spired by
the affair are affected and artificial; and in spite of the warmth of
the expressions in his letters it is hard to believe that his passion
went very deep. In any case, on his return to Mauchline to find Jean
Armour cast out by her own people after having a second time borne him
twins, he faced his responsibilities in a more manly and honorable
fashion than ever before, and made Jean his wife. The explanation of
his final resolution is given repeatedly in almost the same words in
his letters: &ldquo;I found a much loved female's positive happiness or
absolute misery among my hands, and I could not trifle with such a
sacred deposit.&rdquo; It would appear that, however far the affair between
him and Clarinda had passed beyond the sentimental friendship it began
with, he did not regard it as placing in his hands any such &ldquo;sacred
deposit&rdquo; as the fate of Jean, nor had one or two intrigues with
obscure girls in Edinburgh shaken an affection which was much more
deep-rooted than he often imagined. Clarinda was naturally deeply
wounded by his marriage, and her reproaches of &ldquo;villainy&rdquo; led to a
breach which was only gradually bridged. At one time, just before she
set out for Jamaica to join her husband in an unsuccessful attempt at
a re<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>conciliation, Burns's letters again became frequent, the old
fervor reappeared, and a couple of his best songs were produced. But
at this time he had the&mdash;shall we say reassuring?&mdash;belief that he was
not to see her again, and could indulge an emotion that had always
been largely theatrical without risk to either of them. On her return
he wrote her, it would seem, only once. For the character of Burns the
incident is of much curious interest; for literature its importance
lies in the two songs, <i><a href="#AE_FOND_KISS">Ae fond Kiss</a></i> and <i><a href="#MY_NANNIES_AWA">My Nannie's Awa</a></i>. The
former was written shortly before her departure for the West Indies;
the second in the summer of her absence. It is noteworthy that in them
&ldquo;Clarinda&rdquo; has given place to &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nannie.&rdquo; Beside them is
placed for contrast, one of the pure Clarinda effusions.</p>

<h3><a name="SECTION4" id="SECTION4"></a>4. Ellisland</h3>

<p>In the spring of 1788 when Burns married Jean Armour, he took two
other steps of the first<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a> importance for his future career. The
Edinburgh period had come and gone, and all that his intercourse with
his influential friends had brought him was the four or five hundred
pounds of profit from his poems and an opportunity to enter the excise
service. With part of the money he relieved his brother Gilbert from
pressing obligations at Mossgiel by the loan of one hundred and eighty
pounds, and with the rest leased the farm of Ellisland on the bank of
the Nith, five or six miles above Dumfries. But before taking up the
farm he devoted six weeks or so to tuition in the duties of an
exciseman, so that he had this occupation to fall back on in case of
another farming failure. During the summer he superintended the
building of the farm-house, and in December Jean joined her husband.
His satisfaction in his domestic situation is characteristically
expressed in a song composed about this time.</p>

<p>Early in his residence at Ellisland he formed a close relation with a
neighboring proprietor, Colonel Robert Riddel. For him he copied into
two volumes a large part of what he considered the best of his
unpublished verse and prose, thus forming the well-known Glenriddel
Manuscript. Had not one already become convinced of the fact from
internal evidence, it would be clear enough from this prose volume
that Burns's letters were often as much works of art to him as his
poems. This is of supreme importance in weighing the epistolary
evidence for his character and conduct. Even when his words seem to be
the direct outpourings of his feelings&mdash;of love, of<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a> friendship, of
gratitude, of melancholy, of devotion, of scorn&mdash;a comparative
examination will show that in prose as much as in verse we are dealing
with the work of a conscious artist, enamored of telling expression,
aware of his reader, and anything but the naif utterer of
unsophisticated emotion. To recall this will save us from much
perplexity in the interpretation of his words, and will clear up many
an apparent contradiction in his evidence about himself.</p>

<p>Burns was never very sanguine about success on the Ellisland farm. By
the end of the summer of 1789 he concluded that he could not depend on
it, determined to turn it into a dairy farm to be conducted mainly by
his wife and sisters, and took up the work in the excise for which he
had prepared himself. He had charge of a large district of ten
parishes, and had to ride some two hundred miles a week in all
weathers. With the work he still did on the farm one can see that he
was more than fully employed, and need not wonder that there was
little time for poetry. Yet these years at Ellisland were on the whole
happy years for himself and his family; he found time for pleasant
intercourse with some of his neighbors, for a good deal of
letter-writing,<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a> for some interest in politics, and for the
establishing, with Colonel Riddel, of a small neighborhood library. As
an excise officer he seems to have been conscientious and efficient,
though at times, in the case of poor offenders, he tempered justice
with mercy. Ultimately, despairing of making the farm pay and hoping
for promotion in the government service, he gave up his lease, sold
his stock, and in the autumn of 1791 moved to Dumfries, where he was
given a district which did not involve keeping a horse, and which paid
him about seventy pounds a year. Thus ended the last of Burns's
disastrous attempts to make a living from the soil.</p>


<h3><a name="SECTION5" id="SECTION5"></a>5. Dumfries</h3>

<p>The house in which the Burnses with their three sons first lived in
Dumfries was a three-roomed cottage in the Wee Vennel, now Banks
Street. Though his income was small, it must be remembered that the
cost of food was low. &ldquo;Beef was 3d. to 5d. a lb.; mutton, 3d. to
4-1/2d.; chickens, 7d. to 8d. a pair; butter (the lb. of 24 oz.), 7d.
to 9d.; salmon, 6d. to 9-1/2d. a lb.; cod, 1d. and even 1/2d. a lb.&rdquo;
Though hardly in easy circumstances then, Burns's situation was such<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>
that it was possible to avoid his greatest horror, debt.</p>

<p>Meantime, his interest in politics had greatly quickened. He had been
from youth a sentimental Jacobite; but this had little effect upon his
attitude toward the parties of the day. In Edinburgh he had worn the
colors of the party of Fox, presumably out of compliment to his Whig
friends, Glencairn and Erskine. During the Ellisland period, however,
he had written strongly against the Regency Bill supported by Fox; and
in the general election of 1790 he opposed the Duke of Queensberry and
the local Whig candidate. But in his early months in Dumfries we find
him showing sympathy with the doctrines of the French Revolution, a
sympathy which was natural enough in a man of his inborn democratic
tendencies. A curious outcome of these was an incident not yet fully
cleared up. In February, 1792, Burns, along with some fellow officers,
assisted by a body of dragoons, seized an armed smuggling brig which
had run aground in the Solway, and on her being sold, he bought for
three pounds four of the small guns she carried. These he is said to
have presented &ldquo;to the French Convention,&rdquo; but they<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a> were seized by
the British Government at Dover. As a matter of fact, the Convention
was not constituted till September, and the Legislative Assembly which
preceded it was not hostile to Britain. Thus, Burns's action, though
eccentric and extravagant, was not treasonable in law or in spirit,
and does not seem to have entailed on him any unfortunate
consequences.</p>

<p>In the course of that year symptoms of the infection of part of the
British public with revolutionary principles began to be evident, and
the government was showing signs of alarm. The Whig opposition was
clamoring for internal reform, and Burns sided more and more
definitely with it, and was rash enough to subscribe for a Reform
paper called <i>The Gazetteer</i>, an action which would have put him under
suspicion from his superiors, had it become known. Some notice of his
Liberal tendencies did reach his official superiors, and an inquiry
was made into his political principles which caused him no small
alarm. In a letter to Mr. Graham of Fintry, through whom he had
obtained his position, he disclaimed all revolutionary beliefs and all
political activity. No action was taken against him, nor was his
failure to obtain promotion to an Exam<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>inership due to anything but
the slow progress involved in promotion by seniority. Hereafter, he
exercised considerable caution in the expression of his political
sympathies, though he allowed himself to associate with men of
revolutionary opinions. The feeling that he was not free to utter what
he believed on public affairs was naturally chafing to a man of his
independent nature.</p>

<p>Burns's chief enjoyment in these days was the work he was doing for
Scottish song. While in Edinburgh he had made the acquaintance of an
engraver, James Johnson, who had undertaken the publication of the
<i>Scots Musical Museum</i>, a collection of songs and music. Burns agreed
to help him by the collection and refurbishing of the words of old
songs, and when these were impossible, by providing new words for the
melodies. The work finally extended to six volumes; and before it was
finished a more ambitious undertaking, managed by a Mr. George
Thomson, was set on foot. Burns was invited to cooperate in this also,
and entered into it with such enthusiasm that he was Thomson's main
support. In both of these publications the poet worked purely with
patriotic motives and for the love of song, and had no pecuniary
interest in either. Once Thom<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>son sent him a present of five pounds
and endangered their relations thereby; later, when Burns was in his
last illness, he asked and received from Thomson an advance of the
same amount. Apart from these sums Burns never made or sought to make
a penny from his writings after the publication of the first Edinburgh
edition. Twice he declined journalistic work for a London paper.
Poetry was the great consolation of his life, and even in his severest
financial straits he refused to consider the possibility of writing
for money, regarding it as a kind of prostitution.</p>

<p>By the autumn of 1795 signs began to appear that the poet's
constitution was breaking down. The death of his daughter Elizabeth
and a severe attack of rheumatism plunged him into deep melancholy and
checked for a time his song-writing; and though for a time he
recovered, his disease returned early in the next year. It seems
clear, too, that though the change from Ellisland to Dumfries relieved
him of much of the severer physical exertion, other factors more than
counterbalanced this relief. Burns had never been a slave to drink for
its own sake; it had always been the accompaniment&mdash;in those days an
almost<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a> inevitable accompaniment&mdash;of sociability. Some of his
wealthier friends in the vicinity were in this respect rather
excessive in their hospitality; in Dumfries the taverns were always at
hand; and as Burns came to realize the comparative failure of his
career as a man, he found whisky more and more a means of escape for
depression. Even if we distrust the local gossip that made much of the
dissipations of his later years, it appears from the evidence of his
physician that alcohol had much to do with the rheumatic and digestive
troubles that finally broke him down. In July, 1796, he was sent, as a
last resort, to Brow-on-Solway to try sea-bathing and country life;
but he returned little improved, and well-nigh convinced that his
illness was mortal. His mental condition is shown by the fact that
pressure from a solicitor for the payment of a tailor's debt of some
seven pounds, incurred for his volunteer's uniform, threw him into a
panic lest he should be imprisoned, and his last letters are pitiful
requests for financial help, and two notes to his father-in-law urging
him to send her mother to Jean, as she was about to give birth to
another child. In such harassing conditions he sank into delirium, and
died on July 21, 1796.<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a> The child, who died in infancy, was born on
the day his father was buried.</p>

<p>With Burns's death a reaction in popular opinion set in. He was given
a military funeral; and a subscription which finally amounted to one
thousand two hundred pounds was raised for his family. The official
biography, by Doctor Currie of Liverpool, doubled this sum, so that
Jean was enabled to bring up the children respectably, and end her
days in comfort. Scotland, having done little for Burns in his life,
was stricken with remorse when he died, and has sought ever since to
atone for her neglect by an idolatry of the poet and by a more than
charitable view of the man.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br /><br />INHERITANCE: LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE</h2>


<p>Three forms of speech were current in Scotland in the time of Burns,
and, in different proportions, are current to-day: in the Highlands,
north and west of a slanting line running from the Firth of Clyde to
Aberdeenshire, Gaelic; in the Lowlands, south and east of the same
line, Lowland Scots; over the whole country, among the more educated
classes, English. Gaelic is a Celtic language, belonging to an
entirely different linguistic group from English, and having close
affinities to Irish and Welsh. This tongue Burns did not know. Lowland
Scots is a dialect of English, descended from the Northumbrian dialect
of Anglo-Saxon. It has had a history of considerable interest. Down to
the time of Chaucer, whose influence had much to do with making the
Midland dialect the literary standard for the Southern kingdom, it is
difficult to distinguish the written language of Edinburgh<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a> from that
of York, both being developments of Northumbrian. But as English
writers tended more and more to conform to the standard of London,
Northern Middle English gradually ceased to be written; while in
Scotland, separated and usually hostile as it was politically, the
Northern speech continued to develop along its own lines, until in the
beginning of the sixteenth century it attained a form more remote from
standard English and harder for the modern reader than it had been a
century before. The close connection between Scotland and France,
continuing down to the time of Queen Mary, led to the introduction of
many French words which never found a place in English; the proximity
of the Highlands made Gaelic borrowings easy; and the Scandinavian
settlements on both coasts contributed additional elements to the
vocabulary. Further, in its comparative isolation, Scots developed or
retained peculiarities in grammar and pronunciation unknown or lost in
the South. Thus by 1550, the form of English spoken in Scotland was in
a fair way to become an independent language.</p>

<p>This process, however, was rudely halted by the Reformation. The
triumph of this movement<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a> in England and its comparative failure in
France threw Scotland, when it became Protestant, into close relations
with England, while the &ldquo;auld Alliance&rdquo; with France practically ended
when Mary of Scots returned to her native country. Leaders like John
Knox, during the early struggles of the Reformation, spent much time
in England; and when they came home their speech showed the effect of
their intercourse with their southern brethren of the reformed faith.
The language of Knox, as recorded in his sermons and his <i>History</i>, is
indeed far from Elizabethan English, but it is notably less &ldquo;broad&rdquo;
than the Scots of Douglas and Lindesay. Scotland had no vernacular
translation of the Bible; and this important fact, along with the
English associations of many of the Protestant ministers, finally made
the speech of the Scottish pulpit, and later of Scottish religion in
general, if not English, at least as purely English as could be
achieved.</p>

<p>The process thus begun was carried farther in the next generation
when, in 1603, James VI of Scotland became King of England, and the
Court removed to London. England at that time was, of course, much
more advanced in culture than its poorer neighbor to the north, and
the courtiers<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a> who accompanied James to London found themselves marked
by their speech as provincial, and set themselves to get rid of their
Scotticisms with an eagerness in proportion to their social
aspirations. Scottish men of letters now came into more intimate
relation with English literature, and finding that writing in English
opened to them a much larger reading public, they naturally adopted
the southern speech in their books. Thus men like Alexander, Earl of
Stirling, and William Drummond of Hawthornden belong both in language
and literary tradition to the English Elizabethans.</p>

<p>Religion, society, and literature having all thrown their influence
against the native speech of Scotland, it followed that the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the progressive disuse of
that speech among the upper classes of the country, until by the time
of Burns, Scots was habitually spoken only by the peasantry and the
humbler people in the towns. The distinctions between social classes
in the matter of dialect were, of course, not absolute. Occasional
members even of the aristocracy prided themselves on their command of
the vernacular; and among the country folk there were few who could
not<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a> make a brave attempt at English when they spoke with the laird or
the minister. With Burns himself, Lowland Scots was his customary
speech at home, about the farm, in the tavern and the Freemasons'
lodge; but, as we have seen, his letters, being written mainly to
educated people, are almost all pure English, as was his conversation
with these people when he met them.</p>

<p>The linguistic situation that has been sketched finds interesting
illustration in the language of Burns's poems. The distinction which
is usually made, that he wrote poetry in Scots and verse in English,
has some basis, but is inaccurately expressed and needs qualification.
The fundamental fact is that for him Scots was the natural language
of the emotions, English of the intellect. The Scots poems are in
general better, not chiefly because they are in Scots but because they
are concerned with matters of natural feeling; the English poems are
in general poetically poorer, not because they are in English but
because they are so frequently the outcome of moods not dominated by
spontaneous emotion, but intellectual, conscious, or theatrical. He
wrote English sometimes as he wore his Sunday blacks, with dignity but
not with ease; sometimes as he wore<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a> the buff and blue, with buckskins
and top-boots, which he donned in Edinburgh&mdash;&ldquo;like a farmer dressed in
his best to dine with the laird.&rdquo; In both cases he was capable of
vigorous, common-sense expression; in neither was he likely to exhibit
the imagination, the tenderness, or the humor which characterized the
plowman clad in home-spun.</p>

<p><i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">The Cotter's Saturday Night</a></i> is an interesting illustration of these
distinctions. The opening stanza is a dedicatory address on English
models to a lawyer friend and patron; it is pure English in language,
stiff and imitatively &ldquo;literary&rdquo; in style. The stanzas which follow
describing the homecoming of the cotter, the family circle, the
supper, and the daughter's suitor, are in broad Scots, the language
harmonizing perfectly with the theme, and they form poetically the
sound core of the poem. In the description of family worship, Burns
did what his father would do in conducting that worship, adopted
English as more reverent and respectful, but inevitably as more
restrained emotionally; and in the moralizing passage which follows,
as in the apostrophes to Scotia and to the Almighty at the close, he
naturally sticks to English, and in spite of a genuine <a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>enough
exaltation of spirit achieves a result rather rhetorical than
poetical.</p>

<p>Contrast again songs like <i>Corn Rigs</i> or <i><a href="#WHISTLE_AND_ILL_COME_TO_YE_MY_LAD">Whistle and I'll Come To
Thee, My Lad</a></i>, with most of the songs to Clarinda. The former, in
Scots, are genial, whole-hearted, full of the power of kindling
imaginative sympathy, thoroughly contagious in their lusty emotion or
sly humor. The latter, in English, are stiff, coldly contrived,
consciously elegant or marked by the sentimental factitiousness of the
affair that occasioned them. But their inferiority is due less to the
difference in language than to the difference in the mood. When,
especially at a distance, his relation to Clarinda really touched his
imagination, we have the genuinely poetical <i><a href="#MY_NANNIES_AWA">My Nannie's Awa</a></i> and <i><a href="#AE_FOND_KISS">Ae
Fond Kiss</a></i>. The latter poem can be, with few changes, turned into
English without loss of quality; and its most famous lines have almost
no dialect:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Had we never lov'd sae kindly,</div>
<div class="i0">Had we never lov'd sae blindly,</div>
<div class="i0">Never met&mdash;or never parted,</div>
<div class="i0">We had ne'er been broken-hearted.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Finally, there are the English poems to High<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>land Mary. For some
reason not yet fully understood, the affair with Mary Campbell was
treated by him in a spirit of reverence little felt in his other love
poetry, and this spirit was naturally expressed by him in English. But
in the almost English</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;Ye banks and braes and streams around</div>
<div class="i0">The Castle of Montgomery,&rdquo;</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">and in the pure English <i><a href="#TO_MARY_IN_HEAVEN">To Mary in Heaven</a></i>, he is not at all hampered
by the use of the Southern speech, Scots would not have heightened the
poetry here, and for Burns Scots would have been less appropriate,
less natural even, for the expression of an almost sacred theme.</p>

<p>The case, then, seems to stand thus. Burns commanded two languages,
which he employed instinctively for different kinds of subject and
mood. The subjects and moods which evoked vernacular utterance were
those that with all writers are more apt to yield poetry, and in
consequence most of his best poetry is in Scots. But when a theme
naturally evoking English was imaginatively felt by him, the use of
English did not prevent his writing poetically. And there were themes
which he could handle equally well<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a> in either speech&mdash;as we see, for
example, in the songs in <i><a href="#THE_JOLLY_BEGGARS">The Jolly Beggars</a></i>.</p>

<p>Yet the language had an importance in itself. Though its vocabulary is
limited in matters of science, philosophy, religion, and the like,
Lowland Scots is very rich in homely terms and in humorous and tender
expressions. For love, or for celebrating the effects of whisky,
English is immeasurably inferior. The free use of the diminutive
termination in <i>ie</i> or <i>y</i>&mdash;a termination capable of expressing
endearment, familiarity, ridicule, and contempt as well as mere
smallness&mdash;not only has considerable effect in emotional shading, but
contributes to the liquidness of the verse by lessening the number of
consonantal endings that make English seem harsh and abrupt to many
foreign ears. Moreover, the very indeterminateness of the dialect, the
possibility of using varying degrees of &ldquo;broadness,&rdquo; increased the
facility of rhyming, and added notably to the ease and spontaneity of
composition. Thus in Scots Burns was not only more at home, but had a
medium in some respects more plastic than English.</p>

<p>Language, however, was not the only element in his inheritance which
helped to determine the<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a> nature and quality of Burns's production. He
was extremely sensitive to suggestion from his predecessors, and
frankly avowed his obligations to them, so that to estimate his
originality it is necessary to know something of the men at whose
flame he kindled.</p>

<p>As the Northern dialect of English was, before the Reformation, in a
fair way to become an independent national speech, so literature north
of the Tweed had promise of a development, not indeed independent, but
distinct. Of the writers of the Middle Scots period, Henryson and
Dunbar, Douglas and Lindesay, Burns, it is true, knew little; and the
tradition that they founded underwent in the latter part of the
sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries an experience in
many respects parallel to that which has been described in the matter
of language. The effect of the Reformation upon all forms of artistic
creation will be discussed when we come to speak particularly of the
history of Scottish song; for the moment it is sufficient to say that
the absorption in theological controversy was unfavorable to the
continuation of a poetical development. Under James VI, however, there
were a few writers who maintained the tradition, notably<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a> Alexander
Montgomery, Alexander Scott, and the Sempills. To the first of these
is to be credited the invention of the stanza called, from the poems
in which Montgomery used it, the stanza of <i>The Banks of Helicon</i> or
of <i>The Cherry and the Slae</i>. It was imitated by some of Montgomery's
contemporaries, revived by Allan Ramsay, and thus came to Burns down a
line purely Scottish, as it never seems to have been used in any other
tongue. He first employed it in the <i><a href="#EPISTLE_TO_DAVIE_A_BROTHER_POET">Epistle to Davie</a></i>, and it was
made by him the medium of some of his most characteristic ideas.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><i>The Piper of Kilbarchan</i>, by Sir Robert Sempill of Beltrees
(1595?-1661?), set a model for<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a> the humorous elegy on the living which
reached Burns through Ramsay and Fergusson, and was followed by him in
those on Poor Mailie and Tam Samson. The stanza in which it is written
is far older than Sempill, having been traced as far back as the
troubadours in the twelfth century, and being found frequently in both
English and French through the Middle Ages; but from the time of
Sempill on, it was cultivated with peculiar intensity in Scotland, and
is the medium of so many of Burns's best-known pieces that it is often
called Burns's stanza.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The seventeenth century was a barren one for Scottish literature. The
attraction of the larger English public and the disuse of the
vernacular among the upper classes already discussed, drew to the
South or to the Southern speech whatever literary talent appeared in
the North, and it seemed for a time that, except for the obscure
stream of folk poetry, Scottish vernacular litera<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>ture was at an end.
In the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, interest began to
revive. In 1706-9-11 James Watson published the three volumes of his
<i>Choice Collection of Comic and Serious Scots Poems</i>, and in the third
decade began to appear Allan Ramsay's <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>
(1724-40). These collections rescued from oblivion a large quantity of
vernacular verse, some of it drawn from manuscripts of pre-Reformation
poetry, some of it contemporary, some of it anonymous and of uncertain
date, having come down orally or in chap-books and broadsides. The
welcome given to these volumes was an early instance of that renewed
interest in older and more primitive literature that was manifested
still more strikingly when Percy published his <i>Reliques of Ancient
English Poetry</i> in 1765. Its influence on the production of vernacular
literature was evident at once in the original work of Ramsay himself;
and the movement which culminated in Burns, though having its roots
far back in the work of Henryson and Dunbar, was in effect a Scottish
renascence, in which the chief agents before Burns were Hamilton of
Gilbertfield, Ramsay himself, Robert Fergusson, and <a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>song-writers like
Mrs. Cockburn and Lady Anne Lindsay.</p>

<p>Of this fact Burns was perfectly aware, and he was not only candid but
generous in his acknowledgment of his debt to his immediate
predecessors.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">My senses wad be in a creel, <span class="sidenote">head would be turned</span> </div>

<p>He knew Ramsay's collection and had a perhaps exaggerated admiration
for <i>The Gentle Shepherd</i>. This poem, published in 1728, not only
holds a unique position in the history of the pastoral drama, but is
important in the present connection as being to Burns the most signal
evidence of the possibility of a dignified literature in the modern
vernacular. Hamilton and Ramsay had exchanged rhyming epistles in the
six-line stanza, and in these Burns found the model for his own
epistles. Hamilton's <i>Last Dying Words of Bonny Heck</i>&mdash;a favorite
grey-hound&mdash;had been imitated by Ramsay in <i>Lucky Spence's Last
Advice</i> and the <i>Last Speech of a <a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>Wretched Miser</i>, and the form had
become a Scottish convention before Burns produced his <i><a href="#THE_DEATH_AND_DYING_WORDS_OF_POOR_MAILIE_THE_AUTHORS_ONLY_PET_YOWE">Death and
Dying Words of Poor Mailie</a></i>. As important as any of these was the
example set by Ramsay and bettered by Burns of refurbishing old
indecent or fragmentary songs. Robert Fergusson (1750-1774) was
regarded by Burns still more highly than Ramsay, and his influence was
even more potent. In his autobiographical letter to Doctor Moore he
tells that about 1782 he had all but given up rhyming: &ldquo;but meeting
with Fergusson's <i>Scotch Poems</i>, I strung anew my wildly-sounding,
rustic lyre with emulating vigour.&rdquo; In the preface to the Kilmarnock
edition he is still more explicit as to his attitude.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the poems of a Ramsay, or the glorious dawnings of the poor,
unfortunate Fergusson, he, with equal unaffected sincerity,
declares, that, even in the highest pulse of vanity, he has not
the most distant pretensions. These two justly admired Scotch
Poets he has often had in his eye in the following pieces; but
rather with a view to kindle at their flame, than for servile
imitation.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>To be more specific, Burns found the model<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a> for his <i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">Cotter's Saturday
Night</a></i> in Fergusson's <i>Farmer's Ingle</i>, for <i><a href="#THE_HOLY_FAIR">The Holy Fair</a></i> in his
<i>Leith Races</i>, for <i><a href="#SCOTCH_DRINK">Scotch Drink</a></i> in his <i>Caller Water</i>, for <i><a href="#THE_TWA_DOGS">The Twa
Dogs</a></i> and <i>The Brigs of Ayr</i> in his <i>Planestanes and Causey</i>, and
<i>Kirkyard Eclogues</i>. In later years Burns grew somewhat more critical
of Ramsay, especially as a reviser of old songs; but for Fergusson he
retained to the end a sympathetic admiration. When he went to
Edinburgh, one of his first places of pilgrimage was the grave of him
whom he apostrophized thus,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O thou, my elder brother in misfortune,</div>
<div class="i0">By far my elder brother in the muse!</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">And he later obtained from the managers of the Canongate Kirk
permission to erect a stone over the tomb.</p>

<p>The fact, then, that Burns owed much to the tradition of vernacular
poetry in Scotland and especially to his immediate predecessors is no
new discovery, however recent critics may have plumed themselves upon
it. Burns knew it well, and was ever ready to acknowledge it. What is
more important than the mere fact of his inheritance is the use he
made of it. In taking from<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a> his elders the fruits of their experience
in poetical conception and metrical arrangement, he but did what
artists have always done; in outdistancing these elders and in almost
every case surpassing their achievement on the lines they had laid
down, he did what only the greater artists succeed in doing. It is not
in mere inventiveness and novelty but in first-hand energy of
conception, in mastering for himself the old thought and the old form
and uttering them with his personal stamp, in making them carry over
to the reader with a new force or vividness or beauty, that the poet's
originality consists. In these respects Burns's originality is no whit
lessened by an explicit recognition of his indebtedness to the stock
from which he grew.</p>

<p>His relation to the purely English literature which he read is
different and produced very different results. Shakespeare he
reverenced, and that he knew him well is shown by the frequency of
Shakespearean turns of phrase in his letters, as well as by direct
quotation. But of influence upon his poetry there is little trace. He
had a profound admiration for the indomitable will of Milton's Satan,
and he makes it clear that this admiration affected his conduct. The
most fre<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>quent praise of English writers in his letters is, however,
given to the eighteenth-century authors&mdash;to Pope, Thomson, Shenstone,
Gray, Young, Blair, Beattie, and Goldsmith in verse, to Sterne,
Smollett, and Henry Mackenzie in prose. Echoes of these poets are
common in his work, and the most frigid of his English verses show
their influence most clearly. To the sentimental tendency in the
thought of the eighteenth century he was highly responsive, and the
expression of it in <i>The Man of Feeling</i> appealed to him especially.
In a mood which recurred painfully often he was apt to pride himself
on his &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo;: the letters to Clarinda are full of it. The less
fortunate effects of it are seen both in his conduct and in his poems
in a fondness for nursing his emotions and extracting pleasure from
his supposed miseries; the more fortunate aspects are reflected in the
tender humanity of poems like those <i><a href="#TO_A_MOUSE">To a Mouse</a></i>, <i>On Seeing a Wounded
Hare</i>, and <i><a href="#TO_A_MOUNTAIN_DAISY">To a Daisy</a></i>&mdash;perhaps even in the <i><a href="#ADDRESS_TO_THE_DEIL">Address to the Deil</a></i>. He
had naturally a warm heart and strong impulses; it is only when an
element of consciousness or mawkishness appears that his &ldquo;sensibility&rdquo;
is to be ascribed to the fashionable philosophy<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a> of the day and the
influence of his English models.</p>

<p>For better or worse, then, Burns belongs to the literary history of
Britain as a legitimate descendant of easily traced ancestors. Like
other great writers he made original contributions from his individual
temperament and from his particular environment and experience. But
these do not obliterate the marks of his descent, nor are they so
numerous or powerful as to give support to the old myth of the &ldquo;rustic
phenomenon,&rdquo; the isolated poetical miracle appearing in defiance of
the ordinary laws of literary dependence and tradition.</p>

<p>If this is true of his models it is no less true of his methods.
Though simplicity and spontaneity are among the most obvious of the
qualities of his work, it is not to be supposed that such effects were
obtained by a birdlike improvisation. &ldquo;All my poetry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is
the effect of easy composition but laborious correction,&rdquo; and the
careful critic will perceive ample evidence in support of the
statement. We shall see in the next chapter with what pains he fitted
words to melody in his songs; an examination of the variant<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a> readings
which make the establishment of his text peculiarly difficult shows
abundant traces of deliberation and the labor of the file. In the
following song, the first four lines of which are old, it is
interesting to note that, though he preserves admirably the tone of
the fragment which gave him the impulse and the idea, the twelve lines
which he added are in the effects produced by manipulation of the
consonants and vowels and in the use of internal rhyme a triumph of
conscious artistic skill. The interest in technique which this implies
is exhibited farther in many passages of his letters, especially those
to George Thomson.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br /><br />BURNS AND SCOTTISH SONG</h2>


<p>With song-writing Burns began his poetical career, with song-writing
he closed it; and, brilliant as was his achievement in other fields,
it is as a song-writer that he ranks highest among his peers, it is
through his songs that he has rooted himself most deeply in the hearts
of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The most notable and significant fact in connection with his making of
songs is their relation to the melodies to which they are sung. In the
vast majority of cases these are old Scottish tunes, which were known
to Burns before he wrote his songs, and were singing in his ear during
the process of composition. The poet was no technical musician.
Murdoch, his first teacher, says that Robert and Gilbert Burns &ldquo;were
left far behind by all the rest of the school&rdquo; when he tried to teach
them a little church music, &ldquo;Robert's ear, in particular, was
remarkably dull, and<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a> his voice untunable. It was long before I could
get them to distinguish one tune from another.&rdquo; Either Murdoch
exaggerated, or the poet's ear developed later (Murdoch is speaking of
him between the ages of six and nine); for he learned to fiddle a
little, once at least attempted to compose an air, could read music
fairly easily, and could write down a melody from memory. His
correspondence with Johnson and Thomson shows that he knew a vast
number of old tunes and was very sensitive to their individual quality
and suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Such a sentence as the following from<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a> one of his
Commonplace Books shows how important his responsiveness to music was
for his poetical composition.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These old Scottish airs are so nobly sentimental that when one
would compose to them, to <i>south</i> the tune, as our Scottish phrase
is, over and over, is the readiest way to catch the inspiration
and raise the Bard into that glorious enthusiasm so strongly
characteristic of our old Scotch Poetry.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span> </a> The question of the nature and extent of Burns's musical
abilities may be summed up in the words of the latest and most
thorough student of his melodies:&mdash;&ldquo;His knowledge of music was in fact
elemental; his taste lay entirely in melody, without ever reaching an
appreciation of contra-puntal or harmonious music. Nor, although in
his youth he had learned the grammar of music and become acquainted
with clefs, keys, and notes at the rehearsals of church music, which
were in his day a practical part of the education of the Scottish
peasantry, did he ever arrive at composition, except in the case of
one melody which he composed for a song of his own at the age of about
twenty-three, and this melody displeased him so much that he destroyed
it and never attempted another. In the same way, although he practised
the violin, he did not attain to excellence in execution, his playing
being confined to strathspeys and other slow airs of the pathetic
kind. On the other hand, his perception and his love of music are
undeniable. For example, he possessed copies of the principal
collections of Scottish vocal and instrumental music of the eighteenth
century, and repeatedly refers to them in the Museum and in his
letters. His copy of the <i>Caledonian Pocket Companion</i> (the largest
collection of Scottish music), which copy still exists with pencil
notes in his handwriting, proves that he was familiar with the whole
contents. At intervals in his writings he names at least a dozen
different collections to which he refers and from which he quotes with
personal knowledge. Also he knew several hundred different airs, not
vaguely and in a misty way, but accurately as regards tune, time, and
rhythm, so that he could distinguish one from another, and describe
minute variations in the several copies of any tune which passed
through his hands.... Many of the airs he studied and selected for his
verses were either pure instrumental tunes, never before set to words,
or the airs (from dance books) of lost songs, with the first lines as
titles.&rdquo;&mdash;(James C. Dick, <i>The Songs of Robert Burns</i>, 1903, Preface,
pp. viii, ix.)</p></div>

<p>Again, once when Thomson had sent him a tune to be fitted with words,
he replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Laddie lie near me</i> must <i>lie by me</i> for some time. I do not
know the air; and until I am complete master of a tune in my own
singing (such as it is), I never can compose for it. My way is: I
consider the poetic sentiment correspondent to my idea of the
musical expression; then choose my theme; begin one stanza; when
that is composed, which is generally the most difficult part<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a> of
the business, I walk out, sit down now and then, look out for
subjects in nature around me that are in unison and harmony with
the cogitations of my fancy and workings of my bosom, humming
every now and then the air with the verses I have framed. When I
feel my muse beginning to jade, I retire to the solitary fireside
of my study, and then commit my effusion to paper; swinging at
intervals on the hindlegs of my elbow chair, by way of calling
forth my own critical strictures as my pen goes on. Seriously,
this at home is almost invariably my way.&rdquo; [September, 1793.]</p></blockquote>

<p>His wife, who had a good voice and a wide knowledge of folk-song,
seems often to have been of assistance, and a further interesting
detail is given by Sir James Stuart-Menteath from the evidence of a
Mrs. Christina Flint.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Burns dwelt at Ellisland, he was accustomed, after composing
any of his beautiful songs, to pay Kirsty a visit, that he might
hear them sung by her. He often stopped her in the course of the
singing when he found any word harsh and grating to his ear, and
substituted one<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a> more melodious and pleasing.  From Kirsty's extensive
acquaintance with the old Scottish airs, she was
frequently able to suggest to the poet music more suitable to the
song she was singing than that to which he had set it.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Kirsty and Jean were not his only aids in the criticism of the musical
quality of his songs. From the time of the Edinburgh visit, at least,
he was in the habit of seizing the opportunity afforded by the
possession of a harpsichord or a good voice by the daughters of his
friends, and in several cases he rewarded his accompanist by making
her the heroine of the song. Without drawing on the evidence of
parallel phenomena in other ages and literatures, we can be sure
enough that this persistent consciousness of the airs to which his
songs were to be sung, and this critical observation of their fitness,
had much to do with the extraordinary melodiousness of so many of
them.</p>

<p>We have seen that Burns received an important impulse to
productiveness through his cooperation in the compiling of two
national song collections. James Johnson, the editor of the first of
these, was an all but illiterate engraver,<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a> ill-equipped for such an
undertaking; and as the work grew in scale until it reached six
volumes, Burns became virtually the editor&mdash;even writing the prefaces
to several of the volumes. George Thomson, the editor of the other, <i>A
Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs</i>, was a government clerk,
an amateur in music, of indifferent taste and with a preference for
English to the vernacular. In his collection the airs were harmonized
by Pleyel, Kozeluch, Haydn, and Beethoven; and he had the impudence to
meddle with the contributions both of Burns and of the eminent
composers who arranged the melodies. Nothing is more striking than the
patience and modesty of Burns in tolerating the criticism and
alterations of Thomson. The main purpose in both <i>The Scots Musical
Museum</i> and the <i>Select Collection</i> was the preservation of the
national melodies, but when the editors came to seek words to go with
them they found themselves confronted with a difficult problem. To
understand its nature, it will be necessary to extend our historical
survey.</p>

<p>In addition to the effects of the Reformation in Scotland already
indicated, there was another even more serious for arts and letters.
The re<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>action against Catholicism in Scotland was peculiarly violent,
and the form of Protestantism which replaced it was extremely
puritanical. In the matter of intellectual education, it is true,
Knox's ideas and institutions were enlightened, and have borne
important fruit in making prevail in his country an uncommonly high
level of general education and a reverence for learning. But on the
artistic side the reformed ministers were the enemies not only of
everything that suggested the ornateness of the old religion, but of
beauty in every form. Under their influence, an influence
extraordinarily pervasive and despotic, art and song were suppressed,
and Scotland was left a very mirthless country, absorbed in
theological and political discussion, and having little outlet for the
instinct of sport except heresy-hunting.</p>

<p>Such at least seemed to be the case on the surface. But human nature
is not to be totally changed even by such a force as the Reformation.
Especially among the peasantry occasions recurred&mdash;weddings, funerals,
harvest-homes, New-Year's Eves, and the like&mdash;when, the minister being
at a safe distance and whisky having relaxed the awe of the kirk
session, the &ldquo;wee sinfu'<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a> fiddle&rdquo; was produced, and song and the dance
broke forth. It was under such clandestine conditions that the
traditional songs of Scotland had been handed down for some
generations before Burns's day, and the conditions had gravely
affected their character. The melodies could not be stained, but the
words had degenerated until they had lost most of whatever imaginative
quality they had possessed, and had acquired instead only grossness.</p>

<p>Such words, it was clear, Johnson could not use in his <i>Museum</i>, and
the discovery of Burns was to him the most extraordinary good fortune.
For Burns not only knew, as we have seen, the old songs&mdash;words and
airs&mdash;by the score, but was able to purify, complete, or replace the
words according to the degree of their corruption. Various poets have
caught up scraps of folk-song and woven them into their verse; but
nowhere else has a poet of the people appeared with such a rare
combination of original genius and sympathetic feeling for the tone
and accent of the popular muse, as enabled Burns to recreate Scottish
song. If patriotic Scots wish to justify the achievement of Burns on
moral grounds, it is here that their argument lies: for whatever of
coarse<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>ness and license there may have been in his life and writings,
it is surely more than counter-balanced by the restoration to his
people of the possibility of national music and clean mirth.</p>

<p>One can not classify the songs of Burns into two clearly separated
groups, original and remodeled, for no hard lines can be drawn. Since
he practically always began with the tune, he frequently used the
title or the first line of the old song. He might do this, yet
completely change the idea; or he might retain the idea but use none
of the old words. In other cases the first stanza or the chorus is
retained; in still others the new song is sprinkled with here a phrase
and there an epithet recalling the derelict that gave rise to it. Some
are made up of stanzas from several different predecessors, others are
almost centos of stock phrases.</p>

<p>The contribution thus made to Johnson's collection, of songs rescued
or remade or wholly original, amounted to some one hundred
eighty-four; to Thomson's about sixty-four. Some examples will make
clear the nature of his services.</p>

<p><i><a href="#AULD_LANG_SYNE">Auld Lang Syne</a></i>, perhaps the most wide-spread of all songs among the
English-speaking peoples,<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a> is in its oldest extant form attributed on
uncertain grounds to Francis Sempill of Beltrees or Sir Robert
Aytoun.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That still older forms had existed appears from its title
in the broadside in which it is preserved:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An excellent and proper new ballad, entitled Old Long Syne. Newly
corrected and amended, with a large and new edition [sic] of
several excellent love lines.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span> </a> The melody to which the song is now sung is not that to
which Burns wrote it, but was an old strathspey tune. It is possible,
however, that he agreed to its adoption by Thomson.</p></div>

<p>It opens thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Should old acquaintance be forgot</div>
<div class="i2">And never thought upon,</div>
<div class="i0">The Flames of Love extinguish&egrave;d</div>
<div class="i2">And freely past and gone?</div>
<div class="i0">Is thy kind Heart now grown so cold</div>
<div class="i2">In that Loving Breast of thine,</div>
<div class="i0">That thou can'st never once reflect</div>
<div class="i2">On old-long-syne.</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">And so on, for eighty lines.</p>

<p>Allan Ramsay rewrote it for his <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i> (1724), and a
specimen stanza will show that it was still going down-hill:</p>
<div class="poem"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Should auld acquaintance be forgot</div>
<div class="i2">Tho' they return with scars?</div>
<div class="i0">These are the noble hero's lot,</div>

<div class="i0">Welcome, my Varo, to my breast,</div>
<div class="i2">Thy arms about me twine,</div>
<div class="i0">And make me once again as blest</div>
<div class="i2">As I was lang syne.</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">The remaining four stanzas are worse. Burns may have had further hints
to work on which are now lost; but the best, part of the song, stanzas
three and four, are certainly his, and it is unlikely that he
inherited more than some form of the first verse and the chorus.</p>

<p>A more remarkable case of patchwork is <i><a href="#MY_LOVE_IS_LIKE_A_RED_RED_ROSE">A Red, Red Rose</a></i>. Antiquarian
research has discovered in chap-books and similar sources four songs,
from each of which a stanza, in some such form as follows, seems to
have proved suggestive to Burns:</p>

<div class="poem">
<ol>
<li><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Her cheeks are like the Roses</div>
<div class="i2">That blossom fresh in June,</div>

<div class="i2">If I go ten thousand mile.</div>
</div></li></ol></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">The genealogy of the lyric is still more complicated than these
sources imply, but the specimens given are enough to show the nature
of the ore from which Burns extracted the pure gold of his well-known
song:</p>


<h3 class="poemname"><a name="MY_LOVE_IS_LIKE_A_RED_RED_ROSE" id="MY_LOVE_IS_LIKE_A_RED_RED_ROSE"></a>MY LOVE IS LIKE A RED RED ROSE</h3>

<p style="text-indent:0;">Of the songs already quoted, the germ of <i><a href="#AE_FOND_KISS">Ae Fond Kiss</a></i> lies in the

<p style="text-indent:0;"><i><a href="#I_HAE_A_WIFE">I Hae a Wife o' My Ain</a></i>, borrows with slight modification the first
two lines; a model for <i><a href="#MY_NANNIE_O">My Nannie O</a></i> has been found in an anonymous
eighteenth-century fragment as well as in a song of Ramsay's, but
neither contributes more than the phrase which names the tune as well
as the words; <i><a href="#THE_RIGS_O_BARLEY">The Rigs o' Barley</a></i> was suggested by a verse of an old
song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

comparison of their poetical quality with those having their<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a> model or
starting point in an older song will show that, however brilliantly
Burns acquitted himself in his task of refurbishing traditional
material, he was in no way dependent upon such material for
inspiration.</p>

<p>From what has been said of the occasions of these verses, however, it
is clear that inspiration from the outside was not lacking. The
traditional association of wine, woman, and song certainly held for
Burns, nearly all his lyrics being the outcome of his devotion to at
least two of these, some of them, like the following, to all three.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more hopeless than to attempt to classify Burns's
songs according to the amours that occasioned them, and to seek to
find a constant relation between the reality and intensity of the
passion and the vitality of the poetry. At times some relation does
seem apparent, as we<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a> may discern beneath the vigor of the song just
quoted a trace of a conscious attempt to brave his conscience in
connection with the one proved infidelity to Jean after his marriage.
Again, in such songs as <i><a href="#OF_A_THE_AIRTS">Of a' the Airts</a></i>, <i><a href="#POORTITH_CAULD">Poortith Cauld</a></i>, and
others addressed to Jean herself, we have an expression of his less
than rapturous but entirely genuine affection for his wife.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0;">Similarly, most of the lyrics addressed to Clarinda in Edinburgh are
marked by the sentimentalism and affectation of an affair that engaged
only one side, and that among the least pleasing, of the many-sided
temperament of the poet.</p>

<p>But, in general, with Burns as with other poets, it was not the
catching of a first-hand emotion at white heat that resulted in the
best poetry, but the stimulating of his imagination by the vision of a
person or a situation that may have had but the hint of a prototype in
the actual. We have already noted that the best of the Clarinda poems
were written in absence, and that they drop the Arcadian names which
typified the make-believe element in that complex affair. So a number
of his most charming songs are addressed to girls of whom he had had
but a glimpse. But that<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a> glimpse sufficed to kindle him, and for the
poetry it was all advantage that it was no more.</p>

<p>His relations with women were extremely varied in nature. At one
extreme there were friendships like that with Mrs. Dunlop, the letters
to whom show that their common interests were mainly moral and
intellectual, and were mingled with no emotion more fiery than
gratitude. At the other extreme stand relations like that with Anne
Park, the heroine of <i><a href="#YESTREEN_I_HAD_A_PINT_O_WINE">Yestreen I had a Pint o' Wine</a></i>, which were
purely passionate and transitory. Between these come a long procession
affording excellent material for the ingenuity of those skilled in the
casuistry of the sexes: the boyish flame for Handsome Nell; the
slightly more mature feeling for Ellison Begbie; the various phases of
his passion for Jean Armour; the perhaps partly factitious reverence
for Highland Mary; the respectful adoration for Margaret Chalmers to
whom he is supposed to have proposed marriage in Edinburgh; the
deliberate posing in his compliments to Chloris (Jean Lorimer); the
grateful gallantry to Jessie Lewars, who ministered to him on his
deathbed.</p>

<p>In the later days in Dumfries, when his vitality was running low and
he was laboring to supply<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a> Thomson with verses even when the
spontaneous impulse to compose was rare, we find him theorizing on the
necessity of enthroning a goddess for the nonce. Speaking of
<i>Craigieburn-wood</i> and Jean Lorimer, he writes to his prosaic editor:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lady on whom it was made is one of the finest women in
Scotland; and in fact (<i>entre nous</i>) is in a manner to me what
Sterne's Eliza was to him&mdash;a Mistress, or Friend, or what you
will, in the guileless simplicity of Platonic love. (Now, don't
put any of your squinting constructions on this, or have any
clishmaclaver about it among our acquaintances.) I assure you that
to my lovely Friend you are indebted for many of your best songs
of mine. Do you think that the sober gin-horse routine of
existence could inspire a man with life, and love, and joy&mdash;could
fire him with enthusiasm, or melt him with pathos equal to the
genius of your Book? No, no!!! Whenever I want to be more than
ordinary <i>in song</i>; to be in some degree equal to your diviner
airs, do you imagine I fast and pray for the celestial emanation?
<i>Tout au contraire!</i> I have a glorious recipe; the very one that
for his own use was invented by the Divinity of Healing and Poesy
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>when erst he piped to the flocks of Admetus. I put myself in a
regimen of admiring a fine woman; and in proportion to the
adorability of her charms, in proportion you are delighted with my
verses. The lightning of her eye is the godhead of Parnassus, and
the witchery of her smile the divinity of Helicon!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Burns is here, of course, on his rhetorical high horse, and the songs
to Chloris hardly bear him out; but there is much in the passage to
enlighten us as to his composing processes. In his younger days his
hot blood welcomed every occasion of emotional experience; toward the
end, he sought such occasions for the sake of the patriotic task that
lightened with its idealism the gathering gloom of his breakdown. But
throughout, and this is the important point to note in relating his
poetry to his life, his one mode of complimentary address to a woman
was in terms of gallantry.</p>

<p>The following group of love songs illustrate the various phases of his
temperament which we have been discussing. The first two are to Mary
Campbell, and exhibit Burns in his most reverential attitude toward
women:</p>

<p>The stress laid upon that part of Burns's production which has
relation, near or remote,<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a> to his personal experiences with women is,
in the current estimate, somewhat disproportionate. A surprisingly
large number of his most effective songs are purely dramatic, are
placed in the mouth of a man who is clearly not the poet, or, more
frequently, in the mouth of a woman. There is little evidence that
Burns would have been capable of sustained dramatic composition; on
the other hand, he was far from being limited to purely personal lyric
utterance. His versatility in giving expression to the amorous moods
of the other sex is almost as great as in direct confession. A group
of these dramatic lyrics will demonstrate this.</p>

<p>The foregoing are all placed in the mouths of girls, and it is
difficult to deny that they ring as true as the songs that are known
to have sprung from the poet's direct experience. Scarcely less
notable than their sincerity is their variety. Pathos of desertion,
gay defiance of opposition, yearning in absence, confession of
coquetry, joyous confession of affection returned&mdash;these are only a
few of the phases of woman's love rendered here with a felicity that
leaves nothing to be desired. What woman has so interpreted the
feelings of her sex?</p>

<p>The next two express a girl's repugnance at the thought of marriage
with an old man; and the two following form a pair treating the same
theme, one from the girl's point of view, the other from the lover's.
The later verses of <i><a href="#MY_LOVE_SHES_BUT_A_LASSIE_YET">My Love She's but a Lassie Yet</a></i>, however, though
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>full of vivacity, have so little to do with the first or with one
another that the song seems to be a collection of scraps held together
by a common melody.</p>

but hardly inferior to the others in vitality. In them the personal or

<p><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>The songs written by Burns in connection with politics are often
lively and pointed, but they have little imagination, and the passing
of the issues they dealt with has deprived them of general interest.
Two classes of exceptions may be noted. He was, as we have seen,
sympathetically interested in the French Revolution, and the
fundamental doctrine of Liberty, Fraternity, Equality was cast by him
into a poem which, he himself said, is &ldquo;not really poetry,&rdquo; but is
admirably vigorous rhetoric in verse, and has become the classic
utterance of the democratic faith.</p>

<p>The other class of exceptions is the group of songs on Jacobite
themes. The rebellion led by Prince Charles Edward in 1745 had
produced a considerable quantity of campaign verse, almost all without
poetic value; but after the turmoil had died down and the Stuart cause
was regarded as finally lost, there appeared in Scotland a peculiar
sentimental tenderness for the picturesque and unfortunate family that
had sunk from the splendors of a throne that had been theirs for
centuries into the sordid misery of royal pauperism. Burns, whose
ancestors had been &ldquo;out&rdquo; in the '45, shared this sentiment, as Walter
Scott later shared it, both realizing that it had nothing to do with
practical politics. Out of this feeling there grew a considerable body
of poetry, a poetry full of idealism, touched with melancholy, and
atoning for its lack of reality by a richness<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a> of imaginative emotion.
Burns led the way in this unique movement, and was worthily followed
by such writers as Lady Nairne, James Hogg, and Sir Walter himself. He
followed his usual custom of availing himself of fragments of the
older lyrics, but as usual he polished the pebbles into jewels and set
them in gold. Here are a few specimens of this poetry of a lost cause.</p>

<p><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
Such in nature and origin are the songs of Burns. Of some three
hundred written or rewritten by him, a large number are negligible in
estimating his poetical capacity. One cause lay in his unfortunate
ambition to write in the style of his eighteenth-century predecessors
in English, with the accompanying mythological allusions,
personifications, and scraps of artificial diction. Another was his
pathetic eagerness to supply Thomson with material in his undertaking
to preserve the old melodies&mdash;an eagerness which often led him to send
in verses of which he himself felt that their only defense was that
they were better than none. Thus his collected works are burdened with
a considerable mass of very indifferent stuff. But when this has all
been removed, we have left a body of song such as probably no writer
in any language has bequeathed to his country. It is marked, first of
all, by its peculiar harmony of expression with the utterance of the
common people. Direct and simple, its diction was still capable of
carrying intense feeling, a humor incomparable in its archness and sly
mirth, and a power of idealizing ordinary experience without effort or
affectation. The union of these words with the traditional melodies,
on which we have so<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a> strongly insisted, gave them a superb singing
quality, which has had as much to do with their popularity as their
thought or their feeling. This union, however, has its drawbacks when
we come to consider the songs as literature; for to present them as
here in bare print without the living tune is to perpetuate a divorce
which their author never contemplated. No editor of Burns can fail to
feel a pang when he thinks that these words may be heard by ears that
carry no echo of the airs to which they were born. Here lies the
fundamental reason for what seems to outsiders the exaggerated
estimate of Burns in the judgment of his countrymen. What they extol
is not mere literature, but song, the combination of poetry and music;
and it is only when Burns is judged as an artist in this double sense
that he is judged fairly.</p>


<hr class="chapter" />
<h2><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>
<a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />SATIRES AND EPISTLES</h2>


<p>Fame first came to Burns through his satires. Before he had been recognized by
the Edinburgh litterateurs, before he had written more than a handful
of songs, he was known and feared on his own countryside as a
formidable critic of ecclesiastical tyranny. It was this reputation
that made possible the success of the subscription to the Kilmarnock
volume, and so saved Burns to Scotland.</p>

<p>Two characteristics of the Kirk of Scotland had tended to prepare the
people to welcome an attack on its authority: the severity with which
the clergy administered discipline, and the extremes to which they had
pushed their Calvinism.</p>

<p>In spite of the existence of dissenting bodies, the great mass of the
population belonged to the established church, and both their
spiritual privileges and their social standing were at the mercy of
the Kirk session and the presiding minister.<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>
It is difficult for a Protestant community to-day to realize the
extent to which the conduct of the individual and the family were
controlled by the ecclesiastical authorities. Offenses which now would
at most be the subject of private remonstrance were treated as public
crimes and expiated in church before the whole parish. Gavin Hamilton,
Burns's friend and landlord at Mossgiel, a liberal gentleman of means
and standing, was prosecuted in the church courts for lax attendance
at divine service, for traveling on Sabbath, for neglecting family
worship, and for having had one of his servants dig new potatoes on
the Lord's day. Burns's irregular relations with Jean Armour led to
successive appearances by both him and Jean before the congregation,
to receive open rebuke and to profess repentance. Further expiation
was demanded in the form of a contribution for the poor.</p>

<p>Against the discipline which he himself had to suffer Burns seems to
have made no protest, and probably thought it just enough; but what he
considered the persecution of his friend roused his indignation. This
was all the fiercer as he regarded some of the members of the session
as hypocrites, whose own private morals would not<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a> stand examination.
Chief among these was a certain William Fisher, immortalized in a
satire the application of which was meant to extend to the whole class
which he represented.</p>

<p>Still more highly generalized is his <i><a href="#ADDRESS_TO_THE_UNCO_GUID_OR_THE_RIGIDLY_RIGHTEOUS">Address to the Unco Guid</a></i>, a
plea for charity in judgment, kept from sentimentalism by its gleam of
humor. It has perhaps the widest appeal of any of his poems of this
class. One may note that as Burns passes from the satirical and
humorous tone to the directly didactic, the dialect disappears, and
the last two stanzas are practically pure English.</p>

<p>As regards the questions of doctrine there were in the church two main
parties, known as the Auld Lichts and the New Lichts. The former were
high Calvinists, emphasizing the doctrines of election,
predestination, original sin, and eternal punishment. The latter
comprised many of the younger clergy who had been touched by the
rationalistic tendencies of the century, and who were blamed for
various heresies&mdash;notably Arminianism and Socinianism. Whatever their
precise beliefs, they laid less stress than their opponents on dogma
and more on benevolent conduct, and Burns had strong sympathy with
their liberalism. He first appeared in their support in an <i>Epistle to
John Goldie</i>, a Kilmarnock wine-<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>merchant who had published <i>Essays on
Various Important Subjects, Moral and Divine</i>. Though he does not
explicitly accept the author's Arminianism, he makes it clear that he
relished his attacks on orthodoxy. A quarrel between two prominent
Auld Licht ministers gave him his next opportunity, and the
circulation in manuscript of <i>The Twa Herds: or, The Holy Tulyie</i> made
him a personage in the district. With an irony more vigorous than
delicate he affects to lament that</p>

More light is thrown on Burns's positive attitude in religious
matters by his <i><a href="#TO_THE_REV_JOHN_MMATH">Epistle to McMath</a></i>, a young New Licht minister in
Tarbolton. From the evidences of the letters, we are justified in
accepting at its face value the profession of reverence for true
religion made by Burns in this epistle; his hatred of the sham needs
no corroboration.</p>

<p>A further fling at orthodoxy appeared in <i>The Ordination</i>, a piece
written to comfort the Kilmarnock liberals when an Auld Licht minister
was selected for the second charge there. The<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a> tone is again one of
ironical congratulation, and Burns describes the rejoicings of the
elect with infinite zest. Two stanzas on the church music will
illustrate his method.</p>

<p>In the same ironical fashion he digresses in his <i>Dedication to Gavin
Hamilton</i> to satirize the &ldquo;high-fliers'&rdquo; contempt for &ldquo;cold morality&rdquo;

conduct.</p>

<p>The period within which these satires were written was short&mdash;1785 and
1786; but some three years later, on the prosecution of a liberal
minister, Doctor McGill of Ayr, for the publication of <i>A Practical
Essay on the Death of Jesus Christ</i>, which was charged with teaching
Unitarianism, Burns took up the theme again. <i>The Kirk's Alarm</i> is a
rattling &ldquo;ballad,&rdquo; full of energy<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a> and scurrilous wit, but, like many
of its kind, it has lost much of its interest through the great amount
of personal detail. A few stanzas will show that, even after his
absence from local politics during his Edinburgh sojourn, he had lost
none of his gusto in belaboring the Ayrshire Calvinists.</p>

It was inevitable from the nature and purpose of these satirical
poems that, however keen an interest they might raise in their time
and place, a large part of that interest should evaporate in the
course of time. Yet it would be a mistake to regard their importance
as limited to raising a laugh against a few obscure bigots. The evils
that Burns attacked, however his verses may be tinged with personal
animus and occasional injustice, were real evils that existed far
beyond the county of Ayr; and in the movement for enlightenment and
liberation from these evils and their like that was then sweeping over
Scotland, the wit and invective of the poet played no small part. The
development that followed did, indeed, take a direction that he was
far from foreseeing. The moderate party, which he supported, gradually
gained the upper hand in the Kirk, and, upholding as it did the system
of patronage, became more and more associated with the aristocracy who
bestowed the livings. The result was that the moderate clergy
degenerated under prosperity and lost their spiritual zeal; while
their opponents, chastened by adversity, became the champions of the
autonomy of the church, and, in the &ldquo;ten years' conflict&rdquo; that broke
out little<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a> more than a generation after the death of Burns, showed
themselves of the stuff of the martyrs. It would be impossible to
trace the extent of the influence of the poet on the purging of
orthodoxy or on the limitation of ecclesiastical despotism, since his
work was in accord with the drift of the times; but it is fair to
infer that, especially among the common people who were less likely to
be reached by more philosophical discussion, his share was far from
inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The poetical value of the satires is another matter. It may be
questioned whether satire is ever essentially poetry, as poetry has
been understood for the last hundred years. The dominant mood of
satire is too antagonistic to imagination. But if we restrict our
attention to the characteristic qualities of verse satire&mdash;vividness
in depicting its object, blazing indignation or bitter scorn in its
attitude, and wit in its expression, we shall be forced to grant that
Burns achieved here notable success. Of the rarer power of satire to
rise above the local, temporal, and personal to the exhibiting of
universal elements in human life, there are comparatively few
instances in Burns. The <i><a href="#ADDRESS_TO_THE_UNCO_GUID_OR_THE_RIGIDLY_RIGHTEOUS">Address to the Unco Guid</a></i> is perhaps the
finest example; and here, as usually in his work, the ap<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>proach to the
general leads him to drop the scourge for the sermon.</p>

<p>In his tendency to preach, Burns was as much the inheritor of a
national tradition as in any of his other characteristics. A strain of
moralizing is well marked in the Scottish poets even before the
Reformation, and, since the time of Burns, the preaching Scot has been
notably exemplified not only in a professed prophet like Carlyle, but
in so artistic a temperament as Stevenson. Nor did consciousness of
his failures in practise embarrass Burns in the indulgence of the
luxury of precept. Side by side with frank confessions of weakness we
find earnest if not stern exhortations to do, not as he did, but as he
taught. And as Scots have an appetite for hearing as well as for
making sermons, his didactic pieces are among those most quoted and
relished by his countrymen. The morally elevated but poetically
inferior closing stanzas of <i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">The Cotter's Saturday Night</a></i> are an
instance in point; others are the morals appended to <i><a href="#TO_A_MOUSE">To a Mouse</a></i> and
<i><a href="#TO_A_MOUNTAIN_DAISY">To a Daisy</a></i>, and to a number of his rhyming epistles.</p>

<p>These epistles are among the most significant of his writings for the
reader in search of personal revelations. The <i>Epistle to James Smith</i>
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>contains the much-quoted stanza on the poet's motives:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Some rhyme a neebor's name to lash;</div>
<div class="i0">Some rhyme (vain thought!) for needful cash;</div>
<div class="i0">Some rhyme to court the countra clash,  <span class="sidenote">gossip</span> </div>
<div class="i16">An' raise a din;</div>
<div class="i0">For me, an aim I never fash;  <span class="sidenote">trouble about</span> </div>
<div class="i16">I rhyme for fun.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Another gives his view of his equipment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The star that rules my luckless lot,</div>
<div class="i0">Has fated me the russet coat,</div>
<div class="i0">An' damned my fortune to the groat;</div>
<div class="i16">But, in requit,</div>
<div class="i0">Has blest me with a random-shot</div>
<div class="i16">O' countra wit. <span class="sidenote">country</span> </div>
</div></div>

<p>Then he passes from literary considerations to his general philosophy
of life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But why o' death begin a tale?</div>
<div class="i0">Just now we're living sound an' hale;</div>
<div class="i0">Then top and maintop crowd the sail;</div>
<div class="i16">Heave Care o'er-side!</div>
<div class="i0">And large, before Enjoyment's gale,</div>
<div class="i16">Let's tak the tide.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><hr style='width: 45%;' /></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">When ance life's day draws near the gloamin,</div>
<div class="i0">Then fareweel vacant, careless roamin;</div>
<div class="i0">An' fareweel cheerfu' tankards foamin,</div>
<div class="i16">An' social noise:</div>
<div class="i0">An' fareweel dear, deluding Woman,</div>
<div class="i16">The joy of joys!</div>
</div></div>
<p><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>
Here, as often, he contrasts his own reckless impulsive temper with
that of prudent calculation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">With steady aim, some Fortune chase;</div>
<div class="i0">Keen Hope does ev'ry sinew brace;</div>
<div class="i0">Thro' fair, thro' foul, they urge the race,</div>
<div class="i16">And seize the prey:</div>
<div class="i0">Then cannie, in some cozie place, <span class="sidenote">quietly</span> </div>
<div class="i16">They close the day.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And others, like your humble servan',</div>
<div class="i0">Poor wights! nae rules nor roads observin',</div>
<div class="i0">To right or left eternal swervin',</div>
<div class="i16">They zig-zag on;</div>
<div class="i0">Till, curst with age, obscure an' starvin',</div>
<div class="i16">They aften groan.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><hr style='width: 45%;' /></div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O ye douce folk that live by rule,</div>
<div class="i0">Grave, tideless-blooded, calm an' cool,</div>
<div class="i0">Compar'd wi' you&mdash;O fool! fool! fool!</div>
<div class="i16">How much unlike!</div>
<div class="i0">Your hearts are just a standing pool,</div>
<div class="i16">Your lives a dyke!  <span class="sidenote">stone wall</span> </div>
</div></div>

<p>Nothing is more characteristic of the poet than this attitude toward
prudence&mdash;this mixture of Intellectual respect with emotional
contempt. He admits freely that restraint and calculation pay, but
impulse makes life so much more interesting!</p>
<p><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
The <i><a href="#EPISTLE_TO_DAVIE_A_BROTHER_POET">Epistle to Davie, a Brother Poet</a></i>, deserves to be quoted in
full. It contains the final phrasing of the central point of Burns's
ethics, the Scottish rustic's version of that philosophy of
benevolence with which Shaftesbury sought to warm the chill of
eighteenth-century thought:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The heart aye's the part aye</div>
<div class="i0">That makes us right or wrang.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The mood of this poem is Burns's middle mood, lying between the black
melancholy of his poems of despair and remorse and the exhilaration of
his more exalted bacchanalian and love songs&mdash;the mood, we may infer,
of his normal working life. We may again observe the correspondence
between the change of dialect and change of tone in stanzas nine and
ten, the increase of artificiality coming with his literary English
and culminating in the unspeakable &ldquo;tenebrific scene.&rdquo; His humor
returns with his Scots in the last verse.</p>

<p>The didactic tendency reaches its height in the <i><a href="#EPISTLE_TO_A_YOUNG_FRIEND">Epistle to a Young
Friend</a></i>. Here there is no personal confession, but a conscious and
professed sermon, unrelated, as the last line shows, to the practise
of the preacher. It is, of course, only poetry in the
eighteenth-century sense&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed&mdash;</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">and as such it should be judged. The critics who have reacted most
violently against the attempted canonization of Burns have been
inclined to sneer at this admirable homily, and to insinuate
insincerity. But human nature affords every-day examples of just such
perfectly sincere inconsistency as we find between the sixth stanza
and Burns's own conduct; while not inconsistency but a very genuine
rhetoric inspires the characteristic quatrain which closes the
seventh.</p>

<p>The general level of the rhyming letters of Burns is astonishingly
high. They bear, as such compositions should, the impression of free
spontaneity, and indeed often read like sheer improvisations. Yet they
are sprinkled with admirable stanzas of natural description, shrewd
criticism, delightful humor, and are pervaded by a delicate
tactfulness possible only to a man with a genius for friendship. They
are usually written in the favorite six-line stanza, the meter that
flowed most easily from his pen, and in language are the richest
vernacular. His ambition to be &ldquo;literary&rdquo; seldom brings in its jarring
notes here, and indeed at times he seems to avenge himself on this
besetting sin by a very individual jocoseness toward the mythological
figures that intrude into his more serious efforts. His Muse is the
special victim. Instead of the conventional draped figure she becomes
a &ldquo;tapetless, ramfeezl'd hizzie,&rdquo; &ldquo;saft at best an' something lazy;&rdquo;
she is a &ldquo;thowless jad;&rdquo; or she is dethroned altogether:</p>
<div class="poem"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;We'll cry nae jads frae heathen hills</div>

<p>The epigrams, epitaphs, elegies, and other occasional verses thrown
off by Burns and dili<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>gently collected by his editors need little
discussion. They not infrequently exhibit the less generous sides of
his character, and but seldom demand rereading on account of their
neatness or felicity or energy. One may be given as an example:</p>

<h2><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>
<a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br /><br />DESCRIPTIVE AND NARRATIVE POETRY</h2>


<p>The &ldquo;world of Scotch drink, Scotch manners, and Scotch religion&rdquo; was
not, Matthew Arnold insisted, a beautiful world, and it was, he held,
a disadvantage to Burns that he had not a beautiful world to deal
with. This famous dictum is a standing challenge to any critic who
regards Burns as a creator of beauty. It is true that when Burns took
this world at its apparent worst, when Scotch drink meant bestial
drunkenness, when Scotch manners meant shameless indecency, when
Scotch religion meant blasphemous defiance, he created <i><a href="#THE_JOLLY_BEGGARS">The Jolly
Beggars</a></i>, which the same critic found a &ldquo;splendid and puissant
production.&rdquo; We must conclude, then, that sufficient genius can
sublimate even a hideously sordid world into a superb work of art,
which is presumably beautiful.</p>

<p>But the verdict passed on the Scottish world<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a> of Burns is not to be
taken without scrutiny. A review of those poems of Burns that are
primarily descriptive will recall to us the chief features of that
world.</p>

<p>Let us begin with <i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">The Cotter's Saturday Night</a></i>, Burns's tribute to
his father's house. Let us discard the introductory stanza of
dedication, as not organically a part of the poem. The scene is set in
a gray November landscape. The tired laborer is shown returning to his
cottage, no touch of idealization being added to the picture of
physical weariness save what comes from the feeling for home and wife
and children. Then follow the gathering of the older sons and
daughter, the telling of the experiences of the week, and the advice
of the father. The daughter's suitor arrives, and the girl's
consciousness as well as the lover's shyness are delicately rendered.
Two stanzas in English moralize the situation, and for our present
purpose may be ignored. The supper of porridge and milk and a bit of
cheese is followed by a reverent account of family prayers, the father
leading, the family joining in the singing of the psalm. And as they
part for the night, the poet is carried away<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a> into an elevated
apostrophe to the country whose foundations rest upon such a
peasantry, and closes with a patriotic prayer for its preservation.</p>

<p>The truth of the picture is indubitable. The poet could, of course,
have chosen another phase of the same life. The cotter could have come
home rheumatic and found the children squalling and the wife cross.
The daughter might have been seduced, and the sons absent in the
ale-house. But what he does describe is just as typical, and it is
beautiful, though the manners and religion are Scottish.</p>

<p>Another social occasion is the subject of <i><a href="#HALLOWEEN">Halloween</a></i>. The poem, with
Burns's notes, is a mine of folk-lore, but we are concerned with it as
literature. Here the tone is humorous instead of reverent, the
characters are mixed, the selection is more widely representative.
With complete frankness, the poet exhibits human nature under the
influence of the mating instinct, directed by harmless, age-old
superstitions. The superstitions are not attacked, but gently
ridiculed. The fundamental veracity of the whole is seen when we
realize that, in spite of the strong local color, it is
psychologically true for similar festivities among the peasantry of
all countries.</p>

<h4>FOOT-NOTES TO HALLOWEEN</h4>

<p>[The foot-notes to this poem are those supplied by Burns himself in
the Kilmarnock edition.]</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span> </a> Is thought to be a night when witches, devils, and other
mischief-making beings, are all abroad on their baneful, midnight
errands: particularly, those aerial people, the fairies, are said, on
that night to hold a grand anniversary.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span> </a> Certain little, romantic, rocky, green hills, in the
neighbourhood of the ancient seat of the Earls of Cassilis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span> </a> A noted cavern near Colean-house, called the Cove of
Colean; which, as well as Cassilis Downans, is famed in country story
for being a favourite haunt of fairies.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span> </a> The famous family of that name, the ancestors of Robert,
the great Deliverer of his country, were Earls of Carrick.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span> </a> The first ceremony of Halloween is pulling each a
<i>stock</i>, or plant of kail. They must go out, hand in hand, with eyes
shut, and pull the first they meet with: its being big or little,
straight or crooked, is prophetic of the size and shape of the grand
object of all their spells&mdash;the husband or wife. If any <i>yird</i>, or
earth, stick to the root, that is <i>tocher</i>, or fortune; and the taste
of the <i>custoc</i>, that is, the heart of the stem, is indicative of the
natural temper and disposition. Lastly the stems, or to give them
their ordinary appellation, the <i>runts</i>, are placed somewhere above
the head of the door; and the Christian names of the people whom
chance brings into the house, are, according to the priority of
placing the runts, the names in question.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span> </a> They go to the barn-yard, and pull each, at three several
times, a stalk of oats. If the third stalk wants the <i>top pickle</i>,
that is, the grain at the top of the stalk, the party in question will
want the maidenhead.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span> </a> When the corn is in a doubtful state, by being too
green, or wet, the stack-builder, by means of old timber, etc., makes
a large apartment in his stack, with an opening in the side which is
fairest exposed to the wind: this he calls a <i>fause-house</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span> </a> Burning the nuts is a favourite charm. They name the lad
and lass to each particular nut, as they lay them in the fire; and
according as they burn quickly together, or start from beside one
another, the course and issue of the courtship will be.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span> </a> Whoever would with success try this spell must strictly
observe<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a> these directions. Steal out all alone to the kiln, and
darkling, throw into the pot, a clue of blue yarn: wind it in a new
clue off the old one; and towards the latter end, something will hold
the thread: demand, <i>wha hauds</i>? i.e., who holds? and answer will be
returned from the kiln-pot, by naming the Christian and surname of
your future spouse.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span> </a> Take a candle and go alone to a looking glass: eat an
apple before it, and some traditions say you should comb your hair all
the time; the face of your conjugal companion to be will be seen in
the glass, as if peeping over your shoulder.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span> </a> Steal out; unperceived, and sow a handful of hemp seed;
harrowing it with anything you can conveniently draw after you.
Repeat, now and then, &ldquo;Hemp seed, I saw [sow] thee, Hemp seed, I saw
thee; and him (or her) that is to be my true-love, come after me and
pou thee.&rdquo; Look over your left shoulder, and you will see the
appearance of the person invoked, in the attitude of pulling hemp.
Some traditions say, &ldquo;come after me and shaw thee,&rdquo; that is, show
thyself; in which case it simply appears. Others omit the harrowing,
and say, &ldquo;come after me and harrow thee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span> </a> This charm must likewise be performed, unperceived and
alone. You go to the barn, and open both doors; taking them off the
hinges, if possible; for there is danger that the Being about to
appear may shut the doors, and do you some mischief. Then take that
instrument used in winnowing the corn, which, in our country-dialect,
we call a wecht; and go thro' all the attitudes of letting down corn
against the wind. Repeat it three times; and the third time, an
apparition will pass thro' the barn, in at the windy door, and out at
the other, having both the figure in question and the appearance or
retinue, marking the employment or station in life.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span> </a> Take an opportunity of going, unnoticed, to a
bear-stack, and fathom it three times round. The last fathom of the
last time, you will catch in your arms the appearance of your conjugal
yoke-fellow.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span> </a> You go out, one or more, for this is a social spell, to
a south-running spring or rivulet, where &ldquo;three lairds' lands meet,&rdquo;
and dip your left shirt sleeve. Go to bed in sight of a fire, and hang
your wet sleeve before it to dry. Lie awake, and sometime near
midnight, an apparition having the exact figure of the grand object in
question, will come and turn the sleeve, as if to dry the other side
of it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span> </a> Take three dishes; put clean water in one, foul water in
another; and leave the third empty: blindfold a person, and lead him
to the hearth where the dishes are ranged; he (or she) dips the left
hand: if by chance in the clean water, the future husband or wife will
come to the bar of matrimony, a maid: if in the foul, a widow; if in
the empty dish, it foretells, with equal certainty, no marriage at
all. It is repeated three times; and every time the arrangement of the
dishes is altered.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span> </a> Sowens, with butter instead of milk to them, is always
the Halloween supper.</p></div>
<p><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>
In <i><a href="#THE_TWA_DOGS">The Twa Dogs</a></i> we have an entirely different method. Burns here
gives expression to his social philosophy in a contrast between rich
and poor, and adds a quaint humor to his criticism by placing it in
the mouths of the laird's Newfoundland and the cotter's collie. The
dogs themselves are delightfully and vividly characterized, and their
comments have a detachment that frees the satire from acerbity without
rendering it tame. The account of the life of the idle rich may be
that of a somewhat remote observer; it has still value as a record of
how the peasant views the proprietor. But that of the hard-working
farmer lacks no touch of actuality, and is part of the reverse side of
the shield shown in <i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">The Cotter's Saturday Night</a></i>. Yet the tone is not
querulous, but echoes rather the quiet conviction that if toil is hard
it has its own sweetness, and that honest fatigue is better than
boredom.</p>

<p>The satirical tendency becomes more evident in <i><a href="#THE_HOLY_FAIR">The Holy Fair</a></i>. The
personifications whom the poet meets on the way to the religious orgy
are Superstition, Hypocrisy, and Fun, and symbolize exactly the
elements in his treatment&mdash;two-thirds satire and one-third humorous
sympathy.<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a> The handling of the preachers is in the manner we have
already observed in the other ecclesiastical satires, but there is
less animus and more vividness. Nothing could be more admirable in its
way than the realism of the picture of the congregation, whether at
the sermons or at their refreshments; and, as in <i><a href="#HALLOWEEN">Halloween</a></i>, the
union of the particular and the universal appears in the essential
applicability of the psychology to an American camp-meeting as well as
to a Scottish sacrament&mdash;</p>

<p>It must be admitted that, as we pass from poem to poem, Scottish
manners are becoming freer, Scottish drink is more potent, Scottish
religion is no longer pure and undefiled. Yet the poet<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a> hardly seems
to be at a disadvantage. He certainly is no less interesting; he
impresses our imaginations and rouses our sympathetic understanding as
keenly as ever; there is no abatement of our esthetic relish.</p>

<p>We have seen the Ayrshire peasant alone with his family, at social
gatherings, and at church. We have to see him with his cronies and at
the tavern. Scotch manners and Scotch religion we know now; it is the
turn of Scotch drink. The spirit of that conviviality which was one of
Burns's ruling passions, and which in his class helped to color the
grayness of daily hardship, was rendered by him in verse again and
again: never more triumphantly than in the greatest of his
bacchanalian songs, <i><a href="#WILLIE_BREWD_A_PECK_O_MAUT">Willie Brew'd a Peck o' Maut</a></i>. Indeed it would be
hard to find anywhere in our literature a more revealing utterance of
those effects of alcohol that are not discussed in scientific
literature&mdash;the joyous exhilaration, the conviction of (comparative)
sobriety, the temporary intensification of the feeling of good
fellowship. The challenge to the moon is unsurpassable in its
unconscious humor. Yet Arnold thought the world of Scotch drink
unbeautiful.</p>

<p>With greater daring and on a broader canvas Burns has dealt with the
same subject in <i><a href="#THE_JOLLY_BEGGARS">The Jolly Beggars</a></i>. For the literary treatment of the
theme he had hints from Ramsay, in whose <i>Merry Beggars</i> and <i>Happy
Beggars</i> groups of half a<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a> dozen male and female characters proclaim
their views and join in a chorus in praise of drink. More direct
suggestion for the setting of his &ldquo;cantata&rdquo; came from a night visit
made by the poet and two of his friends to the low alehouse kept by
Nancy Gibson (&ldquo;Poosie Nansie&rdquo;) in Mauchline. The poem was written in
1785, but Burns never published it and seems almost to have forgotten
its existence.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the unpromising nature of the theme.
The place is a den of corruption, the characters are the dregs of
society. A group of tramps and criminals have gathered at the end of
their day's wanderings to drink the very rags from their backs and
wallow in shameless incontinence. An old soldier and a quondam
&ldquo;daughter of the regiment,&rdquo; a mountebank and his tinker sweetheart, a
female pickpocket whose Highland bandit lover has been hanged, a
fiddler at fairs who aspires to comfort her but is outdone by a
tinker, a lame ballad-singer and his three wives, one of whom consoles
the fiddler in the face of her husband&mdash;such is the choice company.
The action is mere by-play, drunken love making; the main point is the
songs. They are mostly frank autobiography, all pervaded with<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a> the
gaiety that comes from the conviction that being at the bottom, they
need not be anxious about falling. Wine, women, and song are their
enthusiasms, and only the song is above the lowest possible level.</p>

<p>Such is the sordid material out of which Burns wrought his greatest
imaginative triumph. To take the reader into such a haunt and have him
pass the evening in such company, not with disgust and nausea but with
relish and joy, is an achievement that stands beside the creation of
the scenes in the Boar's Head Tavern in Eastcheap. It is accomplished
by virtue of the intensity of the poet's imaginative sympathy with
human nature even in its most degraded forms, and by his power of
finding utterance for the moods of the characters he conceives. The
dramatic power which we have noted in a certain group of the songs
here reaches its height, and in making the reader respond to it he
avails himself of all his literary faculties. Pungent phrasing, a
sense of the squalid picturesque, a humorous appreciation of human
weakness, and a superb command of rollicking rhythms&mdash;these elements
of his equipment are particularly notable. But the whole thing is
fused and unified by a wonderful vitality<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a> that makes the reading of
it an actual experience. And, though several of the songs are in
English, there is no moralizing, no alien note of any kind to jar the
perfection of its harmony. Scottish literature had seen nothing like
it since Dunbar made the Seven Deadly Sins dance in hell.</p>

<p>The materials for rebuilding Burns's world are not confined to his
explicitly descriptive poems. Much can be gathered from the songs and
satires, and there are important contributions in his too scanty
essays in narrative. Of these last by far the most valuable is <i><a href="#TAM_O_SHANTER">Tam o'
Shanter</a></i>. The poem originated accidentally in the request of a certain
Captain Grose for local legends to enrich a descriptive work which he
was compiling. In Burns's correspondence will be found a prose
ac<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>count of the tradition on which the poem is founded, and he is
supposed to have derived hints for the relations of Tam and his spouse
from a couple he knew at Kirkoswald.</p>

<p>It was a happy inspiration that led him to turn the story into verse,
for it revealed a capacity which otherwise we could hardly have
guessed him to possess. The vigor and rapidity of the action, the
vivid sketching of the background, the pregnant characterization, the
drollery of the humor give this piece a high place among stories in
verse, and lead us to conjecture that, had he followed this vein
instead of devoting his later years to the service of Johnson and
Thomson, he might have won a place beside the author of the
<i>Canterbury Tales</i>. He lacked, to be sure, Chaucer's breadth of
experience and richness of culture: being far less a man of the world
he would never have attained the air of breeding that distinguishes
the English poet: but with most of the essential qualities that charm
us in Chaucer's stories he was well equipped. He had the observant
eye, the power of selection, command of the telling phrase and happy
epithet, the sense of the comic and the pathetic. Beyond Chaucer he
had<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a> passion and the power of rendering it, so that he might have
reached greater tragic depth, as he surpassed him in lyric intensity.</p>

<p>As it is, however, Chaucer stands alone as a story-teller, for <i><a href="#TAM_O_SHANTER">Tam o'
Shanter</a></i> is with Burns an isolated achievement. There are three
distinct elements in the work&mdash;narrative, descriptive, and reflective.
The first can hardly be overpraised. We are made to feel the
reluctance of the hero to abandon the genial inn fireside, with its
warmth and uncritical companionship, for the bitter ride with a sulky
sullen dame at the end of it; the rage of the thunderstorm, as with
lowered head and fast-held bonnet the horseman plunges through it; the
growing sense of terror as, past scene after scene of ancient horror,
he approaches the ill-famed ruin. Then suddenly the mood changes.
Emboldened by his potations, Tam faces the astounding infernal revelry
with unabashed curiosity, which rises and rises till, in a pitch of
enthusiastic admiration for Cutty-Sark, he loses all discretion and
brings the &ldquo;hellish legion&rdquo; after him pell-mell. We reach the
serio-comic catastrophe breathless but exhilarated.</p>

<p>The descriptive background of this galloping <a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>adventure is skilfully
indicated. Each scene&mdash;the ale-house, the storm, the lighted church,
the witches' dance&mdash;is sketched in a dozen lines, every stroke
distinct and telling. Even the three lines indicating what waits the
hero at home is an adequate picture. Though incidental, these
vignettes add substantially to what the descriptive poems have told us
of the environment, real and imaginative, in which the poet had been
reared.</p>

<p>The value of the reflective element is more mixed. The most quoted
passage, that beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;But pleasures are like poppies spread,&rdquo;</div>
</div></div>
<p style="text-indent:0;">can only be regretted. With its literacy similes, its English, its
artificial diction, it is a patch of cheap silk upon honest homespun.
But the other pieces of interspersed comment are all admirable. The
ironic apostrophes&mdash;to Tam for neglecting his wife's warnings; to
shrewish wives, consoling them for their husband's deafness to advice;
to John Barleycorn, on the transient courage he inspires; to Tam
again, when tragedy seems imminent&mdash;are all in perfect tone, and do
much to add the element of drollery that mixes so delightfully with
the weirdness of the scene. And like the other elements in the poem
they are commend<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>ably short, for Burns nearly always fulfills
Bagehot's requirement that poetry should be &ldquo;memorable and emphatic,
intense, and <i>soon over</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Description in Burns is not confined to man and society: he has much
to say of nature, animate and inanimate.</p>

<p>Though within a few miles of the ocean, the scenery among which the
poet grew up was inland scenery. He lived more than once by the sea
for short periods, yet it appears but little in his verse, and then
usually as the great severing element.</p>

<div class="poem"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And seas between us braid hae roar'd</div>
<div class="i2">Sin auld lang syne</div></div>
</div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">is the characteristic line. Scottish poetry had no tradition of the
sea. To England the sea had been the great boundary and defense
against the continental powers, and her naval achievements had long
produced a patriotic sentiment with regard to it which is reflected in
her literature. But Scotland's frontier had been the line of the
Cheviots and the Tweed, and save for a brief space under James IV she
had never been a sea-power. Thus the cruelty and danger of the sea are
almost the only phases prominent in her poetry, and Burns here once
more follows tradition.</p>

<p>Again, the scenery of Ayrshire was Lowland scenery, with pastoral
hills and valleys. On his Highland tours Burns saw and admired
mountains, but they too appear little in his verse. Though not an
unimportant figure in the development of natural description in
literature, he had not reached the modern deliberateness in the
seeking out of nature's beauties for worship or imitation, so that the
phases of natural beauty which we find in his poetry are merely those
which had unconsciously become fixed in a memory naturally retentive
of visual images.</p>
<p><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>
Not only do his natural descriptions deal with the aspects familiar
to him in his ordinary surroundings, but they are for the most part
treated in relation to life. The thunderstorm in <i><a href="#TAM_O_SHANTER">Tam o' Shanter</a></i> is a
characteristic example. It is detailed and vivid and is for the moment
the center of interest; but it is introduced solely on Tam's account.
Oftener the wilder moods of the weather are used as settings for lyric
emotion. In <i>Winter, a Dirge</i>, the harmony of the poet's spirit with
the tempest is the whole theme, and in <i><a href="#MY_NANNIES_AWA">My Nannie's Awa</a></i> the same idea
is treated with more mature art:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Come autumn sae pensive, in yellow and gray,</div>
<div class="i0">And soothe me wi' tidings o' nature's decay;</div>
<div class="i0">The dark, dreary winter, and wild-driving snaw</div>
<div class="i0">Alane can delight me&mdash;now Nannie's awa.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Many poems are introduced with a note of the season, even when it has
no marked relation to the tone of the poem. <i><a href="#THE_COTTERS_SATURDAY_NIGHT">The Cotter's Saturday
Night</a></i> opens with</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh;</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;"><i><a href="#THE_JOLLY_BEGGARS">The Jolly Beggars</a></i> with</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">When lyart leaves bestrew the yird;</div>
</div></div>
<p style="text-indent:0;"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>
<i><a href="#EPISTLE_TO_DAVIE_A_BROTHER_POET">The Epistle to Davie</a></i> with</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">While winds frae off Ben-Lomond blaw,</div>
<div class="i0">An' bar the doors wi' drivin' snaw,</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">though in this last case it is skilfully used to introduce the theme.
These introductions are probably less imitations of the traditional
opening landscape which had been a convention since the early Middle
Ages, than the natural result of a plowman's daily consciousness of
the weather.</p>

<p>For whether related organically to his subject or not, Burns's
descriptions of external nature are to a high degree marked by actual
experience and observation. Even remembering Thomson in the previous
generation and Cowper and Crabbe in his own, we may safely say that
English poetry had hardly seen such realism. Its quality will be
conceived from a few passages. Take the well-known description of the
flood from <i>The Brigs of Ayr</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">When heavy, dark, continued, a'-day rains, <span class="sidenote">all-day</span> </div>
<div class="i0">Wi' deepening deluges o'erflow the plains;</div>
<div class="i0">When from the hills where springs the brawling Coil,</div>
<div class="i0">Or stately Lugar's mossy fountains boil,</div>
<div class="i0">Or where the Greenock winds his moorland course,</div>
<div class="i0">Or haunted Garpal draws his feeble source,</div>
<div class="i0">Arous'd by blust'ring winds an' spotting thowes, <span class="sidenote">thaws</span> </div>
<div class="i0">In mony a torrent down the snaw-broo rowes; <span class="sidenote">melted snow rolls</span> </div>
<div class="i0"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>While crashing ice, borne on the roaring spate, <span class="sidenote">flood</span> </div>
<div class="i0">Sweeps dams, an' mills, an' brigs, a' to the gate; <span class="sidenote">way (to the sea)</span> </div>
<div class="i0">And from Glenbuck, down to the Ralton-key,</div>
<div class="i0">Auld Ayr is just one lengthen'd, tumbling sea;</div>
<div class="i0">Then down ye'll hurl, deil nor ye never rise! <span class="sidenote">devil if</span> </div>
<div class="i0">And dash the gumlie jaup up to the pouring skies! <span class="sidenote">muddy splashes</span> </div>
</div></div>

<p>Any reader familiar with Gavin Douglas's description of a Scottish
winter in his Prologue to the twelfth book of the <i>&AElig;neid</i> will be
struck by the resemblance to this passage both in subject and manner.
It is doubtful whether Burns knew more of Douglas than the motto to
<i><a href="#TAM_O_SHANTER">Tam o' Shanter</a></i>, but from the days of the turbulent bishop in the
early sixteenth century down to Burns's own time Scottish poetry had
never lost touch with nature, and had rendered it with peculiar
faithfulness. It is interesting to note that while <i>The Brigs of Ayr</i>
is Burns's most successful attempt at the heroic couplet, and though
it contains verses that must have encouraged his ambition to be a
Scottish Pope, yet it is sprinkled with touches of natural observation
quite remote from the manner of that master. Compare, on the one hand,
such couplets as these:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Will your poor narrow foot-path of a street,</div>
<div class="i0">Where twa wheel-barrows tremble when they meet,&mdash;</div>

<p style="text-indent:0;"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>
and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And tho' wi' crazy eild I'm sair forfairn <span class="sidenote">old age, sorely worn-out</span> </div>
<div class="i0">I'll be a brig when ye're a shapeless cairn! <span class="sidenote">heap of stones</span> </div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Forms like some bedlam statuary's dream,</div>
<div class="i0">The craz'd creations of misguided whim;</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">As for your priesthood, I shall say but little,</div>
<div class="i4">Corbies and clergy are a shot right kittle; <span class="sidenote">Ravens, sort, ticklish</span> </div>
</div></div>
<p style="text-indent:0;">couplets of which Pope need hardly have been ashamed, with such
touches of nature as these:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Except perhaps the robin's whistling glee,</div>
<div class="i0">Proud o' the height o some bit half-lang tree:</div>
</div></div>
<p style="text-indent:0;">and</p>

of familiar sights and sounds may be supplemented with a few from
other poems.</p>

<p>Closely interwoven with Burns's feelings for natural beauty is his
sympathy with animals. The frequency of passages of pathos on the
sufferings of beasts and birds may be in part due to the influence of
Sterne, but in the main its origin is not literary but is an
expression of a tender heart and a lifelong friendly intercourse. In
this relation Burns most often allows his sentiment to come to the
edge of sentimentality, yet in fairness it must be said that he seldom
crosses the line. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he <a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>had no need
to force the note; it was his instinct both as a farmer and as a lover
of animals to think, when he heard the storm rise, how it would affect
the lower creation.</p>

<p>A number of his most popular pieces are the expression of this
warm-hearted sympathy, a sympathy not confined to suffering but
extending to enjoyment of life and sunshine, and at times leading him
to the half-humorous, half-tender ascription to horses and sheep of a
quasi-human intelligence. Were we to indulge further our conjectures
as to what Burns might have done under more favorable circumstances,
it would be<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a> easy to argue that he could have ranked with Henryson and
La Fontaine as a writer of fables.</p>

<p>To the evidence of Burns's warm-heartedness supplied by these kindly
verses may appropriately be added the <i><a href="#ADDRESS_TO_THE_DEIL">Address to the Deil</a></i>. Burns's
atti<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>tude to the supernatural we have already slightly touched on.
Apart from the somewhat vague Deism which seems to have formed his
personal creed, the poet's attitude toward most of the beliefs in the
other world which were held around him was one of amused skepticism.
<i><a href="#HALLOWEEN">Halloween</a></i> and <i><a href="#TAM_O_SHANTER">Tam o' Shanter</a></i> show how he regarded the grosser
rural superstitions; but the Devil was another matter. Scottish
Calvinism had, as has been said, made him almost the fourth person in
the Godhead; and Burns's thrusts at this belief are among the most
effective things in his satire. In the present piece, however, the
satirical spirit is almost overcome by kindliness and benevolent
humor, and few of his poems are more characteristic of this side of
his nature.</p>

Somewhat akin in nature is <i><a href="#DEATH_AND_DOCTOR_HORNBOOK">Death and Doctor Hornbook</a></i>. The purpose
is personal satire, Doctor Hornbook being a real person, John Wilson,
a schoolmaster in Tarbolton, who had turned quack and apothecary. The
figure of Death is an amazingly graphic creation, with its mixture of
weirdness and familiar humor; while the attack on Hornbook is managed
with consummate skill. Death is made to complain that the doctor is
balking him of his legitimate prey, and the drift seems to be
complimentary; when in the last few verses it appears that in
compensation Hornbook kills far more than he cures.</p>

<p>A few miscellaneous poems remain to be quoted. These do not naturally
fall into any of the major glasses of Burns's work, yet are too
<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>important either for their intrinsic worth or the light they throw on
his character and genius to be omitted. The Elegies, of which he wrote
many, following, as has been seen, the tradition founded by Sempill of
Beltrees, may be exemplified by <i><a href="#TAM_SAMSONS_ELEGY">Tam Samson's Elegy</a></i> and that on
Captain Matthew Henderson. Special phases of Scottish patriotism are
expressed in <i><a href="#SCOTCH_DRINK">Scotch Drink</a></i>, and the address <i><a href="#TO_A_HAGGIS">To a Haggis</a></i>; while more
personal is <i><a href="#A_BARDS_EPITAPH">A Bard's Epitaph</a></i>. In this last we have Burns's summing
up of his own character, and it closes with his recommendation of the
virtue he strove after but could never attain.</p>

<h2><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>
<a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />CONCLUSION</h2>


<p>We have now examined in some detail the main facts of Burns's personal
life and literary production: it is time to sum these up in order to
realize the character of the man and the value of the work.</p>

<p>Certain fundamental qualities are easily traced to his parentage. The
Burnses were honest, hard-working people, stubborn fighters for
independence, with intellectual tastes above the average of their
class. These characteristics the poet inherited. With all his failures
in worldly affairs, he contrived to pay his debts; however obliged to
friends and patrons for occasional aid, he never abated his
self-respect or became the hanger-on of any man; and he showed
throughout his life an eager, receptive, and ever-expanding mind. The
seed sown by his father with so much pains and care in his early
training fell on fruitful soil, and in the range of his information,<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>
as well as in his critical and reasoning powers, Burns became the
equal of educated men. The love of independence, indeed, was less a
family than a national passion. The salient fact in the history of
Scotland is the intensity of the prolonged struggle against the
political domination of England; and there developed in the individual
life of the Scot a corresponding tendency to value personal freedom as
the greatest of treasures. The thrift and economy for which the
Scottish people are everywhere notable, and which has its vicious
excess in parsimony and nearness, is in its more honorable aspects no
end in itself but merely a means to independence. If they are keen to
&ldquo;gather gear,&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">It's no to hide it in a hedge,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor for a train-attendant,</div>
<div class="i0">But for the glorious privilege</div>
<div class="i2">Of being independent.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Along with these substantial and admirable qualities of integrity and
independence Burns inherited certain limitations. In the peasant class
in which he was born and reared, the fierceness of the struggle for
existence has crowded out some of the more beautiful qualities that
need ease and <a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>leisure for their development. The virtues of chivalry
do indeed at times appear among the very poor, but they are the
characteristic product of a class in which conditions are more
generous, the necessaries of life are taken for granted, and the
elemental demands of human nature are satisfied without competitive
striving. When a peasant is chivalrous he is so by virtue of some
individual quality, and in spite of rather than because of the spirit
of his class. Burns was too acute and too observant not to gather much
from the social ideals of the ladies and gentlemen with whom he came
in contact, and what he gathered affected his conduct profoundly; but
at times under stress of frustrated passion or mortified vanity he
reverted to the ruder manners of the peasantry from which he sprang.
So have to be accounted for certain brutalities in his treatment of
the women who loved him or who had been unwise enough to yield to his
fascination.</p>

<p>Other characteristics belong to him individually rather than to his
family or class or nation. He was to an extraordinary degree proud and
sensitive. He reacted warmly to kindness, and showed his gratitude
without stint; but he al<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>lowed no man to presume upon the obligations
he had conferred. He was very conscious of difference of rank, and
never sought to ignore it, however little he thought it mattered in
comparison with intrinsic merit. But the very degree to which he was
aware of the social gap between him and many of his acquaintances put
him ever on the alert for slights; and when he perceived or imagined
that he had received them, his indignation was sometimes less than
dignified and often excessive. Though he knew that he possessed
uncommon gifts, he was essentially modest in fact as well as in
appearance, and on the whole underestimated his genius.</p>

<p>He had a warm heart, and in his relations with his equals he was
genial and friendly. His love of his kind manifested itself especially
in his delight in company, a delight naturally heightened by the
enjoyment of the sense of leadership which his superior wit and
brilliance gave him in almost any society. The customs of the time
associated to an unfortunate degree hard drinking with social
intercourse. But more than the whisky he enjoyed the loosening of
self-consciousness and the warmth of conviviality that it brought.</p>
<div class="poem"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>
<div class="stanza">

<div class="i12">An' then we'll shine!</div>
</div></div>

<p>Burns was not a drunkard. He seems to have taken little alone, and in
the houses of some of his more fashionable friends he resented the
pressure to drink more than he wanted. Nor did he allow dissipation to
interfere with his work on the farm, or his duties in the excise. Yet,
even when contemporary manners have received their share of
responsibility, it must be allowed that on the poet's own confession
he drank frequently to excess, and that this abuse had a serious share
in the breakdown of his constitution, weakened as it was by the
excessive toil of his youth.</p>

<p>He was fond of women, and this passion more than any other has been
the center of the disputes that have raged round his life and
character. Again, contemporary and class customs have to be taken into
account. In spite of the formal disapproval of public opinion and the
censure of the church, the attitude of his class in the end of the
eighteenth century toward such irregulari<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>ties as brought Burns and
Jean Armour to the stool of repentance was much less severe than it
would be in this country to-day. Burns himself knew he was culpable,
but the comparative laxity of the standards of the time made it easier
for him to forgive himself, and prompted him to defiance when he
believed himself criticized by puritan hypocrites. Thus in his
utterances we have a curious inconsistency, his feeling ranging from
black remorse and melancholy, through half-hearted excuse and
justification, to swaggering bravado. And none of them makes pleasant
reading.</p>

<p>But his relations with the other sex were not all of the nature of
sheer passion. He was capable of serious friendship, warm respect,
abject adoration, and a hundred other variations of feeling; and in
several cases he maintained for years, by correspondence and
occasional visits, an intercourse with ladies on which no shadow of a
stain has ever been cast. Such were his relations with Margaret
Chalmers and Mrs. Dunlop. These facts have no controversial bearing,
but they are necessary to be considered if we are to have a complete
view of Burns's relations to society.</p>

<p>In estimating him as a poet, nothing is lost in<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a> keeping in mind the
historical relations which have been so strongly emphasized in recent
years. He himself would have been the last to resent being placed in a
national tradition, but, on the contrary, would have been proud to be
regarded as the last and greatest of Scottish vernacular poets.
Patriotic feeling is frequent in his verse; we have seen how
consciously he performed his work for Johnson and Thomson as a service
to his country; and to the &ldquo;Guidwife of Wauchope House&rdquo; he professed,
speaking of his youth,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">E'en then, a wish (I mind its pow'r),</div>
<div class="i0">A wish that from my latest hour</div>
<div class="i4">Shall strongly heave my breast,</div>
<div class="i0">That I for poor auld Scotland's sake</div>
<div class="i0">Some usefu' plan or book could make,</div>
<div class="i4">Or sing a sang at least.</div>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">So in the line of the Scottish &ldquo;makers&rdquo; we place him, the inheritor of
the speech of Henryson and Dunbar, of the meters and modes of
Montgomery and the Sempills, Ramsay and Fergusson, the re-creator of
the perishing relics of the lost masters of popular song.</p>

<p>His relation to his English predecessors need not again be detailed,
so little of value did they contribute to the vital part of his work.
But<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a> some account should be taken of his connection with the English
literature of his own and the next generation.</p>

<p>The humanitarian movement was well under way before the appearance of
Burns, and the particular manifestations of it in, for example, the
poems of Cowper on animals, owed nothing to the influence of Burns.
But Cowper's hares never appealed to the popular heart with the force
of Burns's sheep and mice and dogs, and the tender familiarity and
wistful jocoseness of his poems to beasts have never been surpassed.
In writing these he was probably, consciously or unconsciously,
affected by the tendency of the time, as he was also in the democratic
brotherhood of <i><a href="#A_MANS_A_MAN_FOR_A_THAT">A Man's a Man for a' That</a></i>, but, in both cases, as we
have seen, part of the impulse, that part that made his utterance
reach his audience, was derived from his personal intercourse with his
farm stock and from his inborn conviction of the dignity of the
individual. His relations to these elements in the thought and feeling
of his day were, then, reciprocal: they strengthened certain traits in
his personality, and he passed them on to posterity, strengthened in
turn by his moving expression.</p>
<p><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>
The situation is similar with regard to his connection with the
so-called &ldquo;return to nature&rdquo; in English poetry. Historians have
discerned a new era begun in descriptive poetry with Thomson's
<i>Seasons</i>; and in Cowper again, to ignore many intermediates, there is
abundance of faithful portraiture of landscape. But Burns was not
given to set description of their kind, and what he has in common with
them lies in the nature of his detail&mdash;the frank actuality of the
images of wind and weather, burn and brae, which form the background
of his human comedy and tragedy. He observed for himself, and he
called things by their own names. In so doing he was once more
following a national tradition, so that he was not &ldquo;returning&rdquo; to
nature, since the tradition had never left it; but, on the other hand,
it is reasonable to suppose that Wordsworth, arriving at a somewhat
similar method by a totally different route, found corroboration for
his theories of the simplification needed in the matter and diction of
poetry in the success of the Scottish rustic who showed his youth</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">How Verse may build a princely throne</div>
<div class="i4">On humble truth.</div>
</div></div>
<p style="text-indent:0;"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>
Wordsworth, of course, like the most distinguished of his romantic
contemporaries, found much in nature that Burns never dreamed of; and
even the faithfulness in detail which Burns shared with these poets
reached a point of subtlety and sensuousness far beyond the reach of
his simple and direct epithets. Nature was to be given in the next
generation a vast and novel variety of spiritual significance. With
all that Burns had nothing to do. He was realist, not romanticist,
though his example operated beneficently and sanely on some of the
romantic leaders.</p>

<p>Yet in Burns's treatment of nature there is imaginative beauty as well
as humble truth. His language in description, though not mystical or
highly idealized, is often rich in feeling, and his personality was
potent enough to pervade his most objective writing. Thus he ranks
among those who have put lovers of poetry under obligation for a fresh
glimpse of the beauty and meaning of the world around them. This
glimpse is so strongly suggestive of the poet that our delight in it
will largely depend on our sympathy with his temperament; yet now and
again he flashes out a phrase whose imaginative value is absolute,
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>and which makes its appeal without respect to the author:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">The wan moon is setting behind the white wave,</div>
<div class="i4">And time is setting with me, oh!</div>
</div></div>
<p>Apart from the respects in which Burns is the inheritor and perfecter
of the vernacular traditions, and apart from his contact, active or
passive, with the English poets of his time, there is much in his
poetry which is thoroughly his own. It does not lie mainly in his
thinking, robust and shrewd though that is. We perceive in his work no
great individual attitude toward life and society such as we are
impelled to perceive in the work of Goethe; we find no message in it
like the message of Browning. What he does is to bring before us
characters, situations, moods, images, that belong to the permanent
and elemental in our nature. These are presented with a sympathy so
living, a tenderness so poignant, a humor so arch and so sly, that
they become a part of our experience in the most delightful and
exhilarating fashion. Part of the function of poetry is to prevent us
from becoming sluggish In our contemplation of life by making us feel
it fresh, vivid, pulsing; and this Burns notably ac<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>complishes.
Coleridge's image of wetting the pebble to bring out its color and
brilliance is peculiarly apt in the case of Burns; for it was the
common if not the commonplace that he dealt with, and his workmanship
made it sparkle like a jewel.</p>

<p>In the long run the value of an author depends on two factors, the
nature of his insight and his power of expression. Burns's insight
into his own nature was deep and on the whole just, and that nature
was itself rich enough to teach him much. He found there the great
struggle between impulse and will&mdash;fiery, surging impulse and a
stubborn will. This experience, illuminated by a lively imagination,
gave him a sympathetic understanding of extraordinary range, extending
from the domestic troubles of the royal family and the perplexities of
the prime minister to the precarious adventures of a louse. His
insight into external nature blended the weather wisdom of the
ploughman with the poet's sensitiveness to the harmony or discord of
wind and sky with the moods of humanity.</p>

<p>For the expression of all this he had an instrument that did not
reach, it is true, to the great tragic tones of Shakespeare nor to the
deli<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>cate and filmy subtleties of Shelley. But he could utter pathos
almost intolerably piercing, and overwhelming remorse; gaiety as fresh
and inspiriting as the song of a lark; roistering mirth; keen irony;
and a thousand phases of passion. This he did in a verse of amazing
variety&mdash;sometimes tender and caressing; sometimes rushing like a
torrent.</p>

<p>Finally, it must be insisted again, in that aspect in which he is most
nearly supreme, the writing of songs, he is musician as well as poet.
Though he made no tunes, he saved hundreds; saved them not merely for
the antiquary and the connoisseur but for the great mass of lovers of
sweet and simple melody; saved them by marrying them to fit and
immortal words. It is for this most of all that Scotland and the world
love Burns.</p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
